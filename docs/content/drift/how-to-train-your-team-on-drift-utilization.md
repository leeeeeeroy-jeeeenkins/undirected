# How to Train Your Team on Drift Utilization

Eons ago, when the universe was a little less tech-savvy than it is today, I stumbled upon Drift—like tripping over a hidden treasure in a modern digital jungle. I recall that day vividly. We were grappling with what we then considered cutting-edge— antiquated, really—live chat software that hadn’t seen an update since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, or at least it felt that way. Sara from marketing looked up from her mountain of sticky notes and suggested we try this Drift thing.

## The Lightbulb Moment

Remember when we first started tinkering with Drift? It was like discovering fire. There's Sara again, sipping her third coffee and pointing excitedly at her laptop screen: “Look, it’s like magic! They answer instantly!” Our initial dance with Drift was a hesitant waltz, admittedly, filled with missteps and the occasional crash ('Disconnected! Try again later').

Drift wasn't just a tool it was more like a portal into customers’ minds. We knew we had to get everyone on board. This meant training the team. Start with the basics. Gather everyone around—pretend we're tech archaeologists discovering an ancient relic. We began by exploring the interface together, clicking on icons like they were forbidden buttons labeled "Do not touch." With each click, Drift showed us a new trick—and that was thrilling.

### Building Confidence Organically

Remember our session with Tony from sales? Watching him struggle with Drift initially was like watching a giraffe trying to roller skate. But suddenly, there was a spark! He screamed, "Eureka!" - yes, like an old-timey scientist. We encouraged exploratory learning—allowed the team to uncover the nuances of Drift organically. Nudge and guide when needed, but give them space to play. And when someone mastered a feature, they would share it gleefully like finding money in an old coat pocket.

An idea took root: why not create our own 'Drift Challenge'? Each feature mastered earned a coffee shop voucher—even the shyest among us was talking bots and workflows in no time.

### Keeping the Ball Rolling

Let’s fast forward—remember our weekly Drift updates, complete with sticky pastries brought in by Tom, who claimed he baked them himself? Those sessions were crucial in maintaining the momentum. Drift was evolving and we kept up by sharing the latest tips we'd scouted. We borrowed features knowingly, tested theories, even created a Drift-specific whatsapp group where Sara could share cat GIFs—those always seemed to lighten any frustration.

We developed a sense of camaraderie and connection. Drift wasn't just another piece of software. It was an extension of our continuing journey of learning and engagement.

### Reflect and Refine

And then came that day—I remember Sara distinctly—, she said, “We’ve come a long way, huh?” True, we had. Drift had gone from a foreign entity to an indispensable ally, almost like the friendly office dog who knows when people need a wagging tail. We took moments to reflect, to appreciate how far we had come, and importantly, where we could improve. Not just improve but thrive.

To top it all, during our annual review, Tony jokingly called Drift "our team's secret weapon," and our manager agreed with a knowing smile.

So here’s to anyone starting on their Drift journey: unravel it with flair, stumble and learn, imbibe the essence, and most importantly, let it become part of your story, just as it has become ours. A well-trained team using Drift doesn’t just benefit the company—it's a ripple effect. Clients feel it, partners know it, and together, like us, you’ll blaze brilliant trails.
