# Using Influitive to Crowdsource Customer Content

It wasn't a typical Thursday. Rhonda and I were balancing steaming cups of coffee as we huddled in the office lounge, our conversation spiraling. A snippet from that morning's company briefing flickered like a firefly in my mind. Management wanted more "authentic" content - whatever that meant - something to humanize our brand's digital presence. We both looked at each other, eyebrows raised in skeptical curiosity as the corporate jargon bounced around, echoing hollowly. Then it clicked: What if our customers could tell our story for us?

Using Influitive to crowdsource customer content. At first it sounded like we were surrendering the keys to the business kingdom to an unruly mob. But no, it turned out to be something beautifully unexpected.

## The Magic Begins

Let's rewind a bit. Influitive, a platform designed to harness the power of our customers' voices and turn them into powerful brand tales, beckoned us like Willy Wonka’s golden ticket. Who knew our customers had so much to say? Well, Rhonda and I were about to find out. We began exploring the idea of assembling a small community of our most engaged customers. Their enthusiasm would fuel user-generated content creation, oh-boy, were we in for a rollercoaster.

### Finding Our Advocates

The "aha" moment was akin to discovering that lost sock behind the dryer. You feel both happy and slightly silly because, of course, that’s where it was all along. We realized our greatest brand assets were already out there; they were just waiting to be heard. The task? Identifying these potential brand advocates. We zeroed in on those customers who raved about us on social media, left glowing reviews, or simply had the sparkly eyes of pure joy when talking about our products - and yes, we consulted spreadsheets, lots of them.

The first step we took was reaching out to these super-users. Invitations were sent, sprinkled with a pinch of excitement. We made it personal, weaving in tips and a sense of belonging. Then, we strapped ourselves in and waited for that thrilling descent - when our inboxes filled with enthusiastic RSVPs.

### Creating the Experience

Above my desk is a scrap of paper tacked to the pinboard that reads, "Experience is everything." It stands as a reminder that even the smallest interaction can build or break trust. Influitive enabled us to transform customer participation into a delightful journey, akin to the adventure stories we cherished as kids. 

Through Influitive, we crafted an environment where sharing felt less like marketing and more like storytelling around a cozy campfire. Customers earned points, unlocked badges, and yes - received virtual high-fives and actual perks. All this by sharing their genuine experiences, sometimes with whimsical selfies showcasing our products in everyday life. My favorite was a picture of someone using our product while hiking a mountain trail at dawn, capturing both a breathtaking view and a satisfied grin.

#### Building and Engaging

Cue us, Rhonda and me, reminiscent of those ancient scriptwriters furiously penning at candle-lit desks. We brainstormed and built a series of campaigns - or to use more relatable terms, mini-adventures. Each one a unique prompt. From sharing stories about how our product thankfully saved their day from disaster - when it rained cats and dogs on their planned BBQ party - to playful contests involving creative uses of our products, themed photoshoots, or storytelling challenges.

The thrill was mutual; our users relished the opportunity to contribute. They weren't just customers now; they were co-creators in our brand narrative. It was like they'd stumbled into Narnia, a delightful discovery of their own creativity and influence. At the same time, we found ourselves learning and evolving too. Witnessing the stories our customers were eager to tell, we grew more attuned to their desires and pain points. It was enlightening, like tasting a new cuisine that instantly felt like home.

### The Community Flourishes

Days passed, becoming weeks, and our virtual community blossomed. What began as a seed of an idea was now an intricate web of authentic stories, each thread delicately intertwined with our brand’s vision. Our customers felt empowered, and the brand—our brand—gained a fresh lease on life, invigorated by organic narratives, committed testimonials, and genuine advocacy. People trusted us not because we said we were great, but because others, real and relatable, did.

#### Measuring Success

Anyone who says they dislike poring over analytics and reports likely hasn’t experienced the Eureka! moment when numbers tell a compelling tale. Through Influitive, we monitored the engagement level, the qualitative impact on our brand sentiment, and the quantitative boost in our metrics. The findings? Astonishing, as if watching a dark night conjure into a dawn awash with colors.

It wasn’t just about the uptick in positive reviews or the influx of new leads. It was deeper—a transformation in how our brand was perceived. An authentic camaraderie flourished, converting passive users into fervent advocates. These advocates, in turn, sparked ripples of interest among their circles, creating a meaningful chain reaction. 

### Learning From the Journey

As we sat back and reflected on our journey, Rhonda mused about unexpected joys. The real treasure wasn't even the metrics or the newfound social media buzz, but the deepening connection with our customers. They'd become friends and collaborators, individuals whose opinions genuinely shaped us.

This is the heart of our narrative—how Influitive facilitated not just brand enhancement, but community creation in the truest sense. It forged paths where stories flow like rivulets, contributing to a greater stream of shared experiences. And isn’t it delightful when a business decision turns into a catalyst for human connection?

### The Conclusion of Our Adventure

Here we are, back in the office lounge, sipping once more on lukewarm coffee, grinning like school kids sharing a secret. We embark on new campaigns constantly, each a step on the road of continuous engagement, laying down stories like stepping stones over which others can tread and perhaps add their own. Our customer-centric fantasy is a vibrant reality, and it feels genuinely refreshing.

In constructing this living tale—a tapestry of human experiences—through Influitive, we didn't just find a tactical edge or a marketing quick win. We found authenticity in an ocean of corporate noise. Isn't that something worth celebrating?

As our conversation winds down, I look at Rhonda and recount, “Remember when we thought crowdsourcing sounded like surrender?” We both smile, knowing our 'surrender' has instead led us to victory—a sweet, genuine victory orchestrated by the wonderfully unpredictable voices of our community.

And as for Influitive, we're simply grateful. It opened a window into a world of co-creation we hadn’t realized thrummed under our noses. Plus, it allowed us to wrap storytelling smoothly into the business—nurturing relationships one tale at a time.

Our advice to fellow adventurers? Step into the world of customer content with Influitive and watch as your brand transforms into an ever-evolving narrative penned by those who love you the most. After all, isn’t the beauty of stories that they are forever telling themselves anew?

So here’s to the journey, unexpected friendships, and the magic of a story well-told—or perhaps, a story well-shared. Cheers to new beginnings.
