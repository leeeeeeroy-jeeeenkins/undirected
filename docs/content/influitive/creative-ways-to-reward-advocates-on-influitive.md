# Creative Ways to Reward Advocates on Influitive

One might think that a journey into the world of advocate reward systems on Influitive would be as straightforward as sipping a neat glass of lemonade on a summer afternoon. Oh, how wrong that would be. It all started on a blustery Tuesday when, like Alice peeking down the rabbit hole, I found myself contemplating an email from Caitlyn, our team’s customer success ambassador and unofficial morale captain. “We need to spice things up for our advocates,” she declared with her characteristic, unshakeable zest. As a digital marketing coordinator perpetually cognizant of stringent budgets and ROI, I knew we had to get inventive. No generic gift cards or blandly “useful” branded mugs would cut it this time. We needed a fiesta of creativity. Thus began our venture into Influitive's intriguing realm.

## A Heartfelt Welcome with a Twist

A special kind of welcome can be the beginning of a beautiful relationship. When Caitlyn and I decided to handcraft unique welcome videos, I thought we'd gone overboard. But, oh, the delight it sparked! These weren't your run-of-the-mill recordings. Each was tailored with snippets of previous interactions, insider jokes, and a sparkle of unseriousness. The virtual tête-à-tête created a sense of belonging from the get-go. We unleashed our inner Spielbergs to film in our humble office confines. Were these Oscar-worthy productions rendering us sleepless in Seattle with editing? Hardly. Yet, the joy of seeing advocates light up was our standing ovation. 

**How to Do It**: Grab a decent mobile phone (DJI Osmo gimble optional, for the ambitious), be genuine, narrate stories that resonate, and let your hair down. Mention the advocate by name, thank them for being amazing, and share how they’ve influenced you or your project. Remember, a consistent backdrop helps—our generic wall eventually adorned with framed doodles—and aims for that personal touch which no Hollywood studio can replicate.

## Gamification — Elevating Engagement

Imagine a quaint game night with friends that morphs into a grand weekly event where laughter echoes off the walls…but virtually. That’s what gamifying the advocate experience felt like. Influitive allowed us to incorporate challenges—both relatable and wacky—that sparked curiosity and engagement, from sharing insightful product tips to silly-photo scavenger hunts. With a daring sprinkle of competition, the leaderboard ignited a playful urge to conquer.

The moment that hit home was when our advocate Bob, who had been a quiet observer, suddenly found himself hooked on our interstellar trivia challenge. “I never knew my love for sci-fi could earn me rewards,” he chuckled over a virtual latte with us. That’s when we realized gamification wasn’t just engagement—this was revolutionizing how we connected.

**How to Do It**: Use Influitive’s feature to craft challenges that align with advocate interests. Create a variety with themes ranging from thematic season-based events to specific tech-related topics. Offer badges or goofy titles as light-hearted incentives but don’t forget to include meaningful rewards, perhaps an exclusive company sneak peek or an industry-relevant eBook. The trick is variety—keep 'em guessing.

## The Magnificent Reward Box

Envision this: a gloriously mysterious box gracing an advocate’s doorstep, filled with delectable goodies and intriguing artifacts. We dubbed our own concoction the “Joy Box,” initially an impromptu suggestion during a caffeine-fueled brainstorming session. Each item? A thoughtful piece of our gratitude, from artisanal chocolates belted with gold ribbons—said chocolates were excessive but Caitlyn assured me, “Everyone deserves a bit of indulgence”—to branded socks that raised eyebrows but warmed feet. 

It was when Jane, typically reticent, send us a picture of her young daughter excitedly unveiling the box like it contained Willy Wonka’s secrets that we grasped the emotional tickle we had achieved.

**How to Do It**: Coordinate with local vendors or crafters to curate a box filled with items reflecting your team’s ethos and the advocate's taste. Refresh inventories regularly, toss in some unexpected flair like personalized notes or even a Spotify playlist link they might enjoy. The goal? A delightful surprise for their senses crafted with love.

## Personal Milestones in Big Celebrations

One day, during an idle scroll through social media, Caitlyn spotted Andrew’s post about his image—an unsuspecting photo of him beaming in a graduation cap and gown. Light bulb moment: why not celebrate advocate milestones? The creation of the “Milestone Wall,” a digital hall of fame where birthdays, graduations, work anniversaries, or quite frankly, wins of any kind—"Survived Monday and still smiling!" —were toasted in exuberant virtual gatherings.

Andrew’s bewilderment over a surprise congratulatory video call led by many, including his family, reminded us that these small celebrations go beyond a simple ‘congrats,’ amplifying a culture of warmth and inclusion. 

**How to Do It**: Stay attuned to their personal milestones through interactions. Use Influitive’s platform to initiate shout-outs and celebrate with a flare: virtual parties, custom-made e-cards, or an impromptu digital toast (bubbly optional). Tailor the recognition to be personal and heartfelt. Be prepared to celebrate a myriad of achievements, big or small.

## Knowledge Sharing – The Advocate’s Lounge

The humbling realization dawned when an advocate queried us for advice on starting his podcast—evidently impressed by our chaotic yet charming podcasting endeavors. Boom! We introduced the “Advocate’s Lounge,” a secluded space on Influitive where wisdom was exchanged in a swirl of questions and insightful discussions. Picture it as an intellectual speakeasy of sorts, sans the clandestine entrance.

Engagement snowballed as advocates poured in with queries, wisdom, and laughter, transforming passive followers into active participants thriving on shared learning. This reciprocal knowledge flow was not only enriching but exploding with community spirit.

**How to Do It**: Open a dedicated area within Influitive for your advocates to ask and offer advice. Foster a welcoming environment by initiating dialogues, setting up thought-provoking topics, and remembering to be an active participant. Host mini virtual workshops, guest speaker events, or even open mic nights for more seasoned advocates. Let the walls whisper diverse ideas and opinions.

## A Surprise Within a Big Picture

Whimsical art—especially murals—often pulls me into daydreams. When Caitlyn suggested involving advocates in designing our office wall mural, it struck me as absurdly genius. So, this mural, born from a collaboration of eclectic advocate ideas and a combustive mix of media, unfolded in our workspace, symbolizing collective creativity. 

The day we unveiled it over a videocall—after weeks of sneaky painting sessions and endless color debates—was electric. At the heart of it? Claudia’s cat, which had somehow found its way into this abstract concoction, crowned in what would become an unwritten chronic homage to our creative advocates. 

**How to Do It**: Propose an artwork or project where advocates contribute ideas or pieces. Whether physical murals or virtual galleries, focus on inclusivity and storytelling. Let each advocate’s contribution breathe individuality, capturing the spirit of combined endeavor. Ensure it’s an evolving, living masterpiece—changing as your stories do.

## Sending Off with Style

The end of any epic journey calls for celebration, even if it's as simple as an advocate moving onto new ventures. Sending people off in style wasn’t instinctive—farewells aren’t glamorous. However, they can be heartfelt. Our solution was equally simple: a heartfelt letter reflecting their contributions, woven with inside jokes, anecdotes, and future well-wishes. 

Note: Remember Jeff, who was leaving to pursue his long-time passion for cross-country cycling? Our tailored goodbye included a hand-picked route suggestion inspired by advocate stories! His enthusiastic, word-packed ‘thank you’ had us teary-eyed.

**How to Do It**: Bid adieu by crafting personal notes or video thank-you messages. Connect their time spent with stories that impacted everyone and wish them well on their endeavors ahead. Keeping it sincere, sprinkle in personalized mementos if possible, acknowledging them as part of your evolving story.

Through these creative turmoils and joyful epiphanies, Caitlyn and I crafted a tapestry of personalized rewards rooted deep in gratitude and mutual growth. We realized it's the shared laughter, personalized touches, and human connection that infuse the advocate journey with spirit. The lessons learned? Stay genuine, remain whimsical, and never underestimate the power of unconventional genius.

So let’s embrace this adventure on Influitive, and keep the magic alive in our endeavors. After all, in this curious blend of digital connection and heartfelt creativity, we’re writing our own stories, one advocate at a time.
