# Using Influitive to Influence Customer Journey

You know, there was this one time when Sarah, one of our most dedicated customers, sent us a video—totally unexpected, by the way. Picture this: she was standing in her kitchen, surrounded by all our products, singing a song she wrote about how they saved her mornings, using nothing but a spatula as a prop mic. I couldn't stop laughing. But here's the thing, that grainy video did more for our brand love than any fancy ad campaign. It was a lightbulb moment that got us exploring Influitive and how it could create more moments like Sarah’s. Here’s the deal: when customers become advocates, the journey doesn’t just become memorable—it transforms into an adventure they want to herald to others.

## The Genesis of Exploration

We all know a story starts somewhere, so rewind a bit. It began with cups of coffee—both virtual and otherwise—discussions that ran late into the night, poring over notes hoping to unlock the mystery of customer journeys. It wasn’t until Greg, our data guy who had a penchant for wearing sunglasses indoors, suggested Influitive that we stumbled upon a chance to create genuine engagement. "We need to stop acting like we're in a Shakespearean drama," Greg announced one night, chomping noisily on carrot sticks—his snack of choice. "Think like customers, not traffic." He was onto something.

Through Influitive, we realized we could mimic the authenticity of Sarah's video, not by fabricating it but by providing avenues for it to thrive, encouraging customers to share unfiltered and authentic experiences. Now, let's delve into this magical world of Influitive and see how we can influence our beloved customer's journey, shall we?

## Creating the Stage for Customer Advocacy

Remember our spontaneous friend, Sarah? The same enthusiasm she had is what we aimed to channel using Influitive. It’s not about meticulously orchestrating every customer move but instead giving them a stage to perform. 

### Setting Up Influitive: A Love Letter to Clarity

You might wonder, where does one even start? First, set up and customize your Influitive hub. Let it reflect your brand’s ethos, much like decorating a space at home to make it your own. The tool wasn’t alien to us, but getting it to mirror our personalities required trial and error—and many, many tweaks. Think of it like painting a picture that captures your company's essence while inviting your customers to paint alongside you. 

To dig deeper than skin-deep (branding assistant jargon-free, remember?), a dashboard is presented where you control what your advocates see. Greg mentioned, half-distracted by an episode of something sci-fi, "KISS – Keep It Simple, Sherlock." He's not wrong. Declutter, prioritize, and let usability triumph above all else.

### Creating Compelling Engagement 

Now, raise your hands if you think filling forms is fun. If nobody is raising, congratulations, you feel the same as our customers. Instead of forms, create engaging challenges that customers would undertake out of pure enthusiasm. Challenges could be anything: sharing a creative photo using your product, writing about a memorable experience, or perhaps singing an improvised song with a spatula—we laugh, but Sarah did it. Rewards in badges, points, or even mysterious unlockables create a gamified experience, subtly encouraging that extra mile.

## Cultivating Genuine Stories

Peppered amidst our several caffeine-fueled escapades were discussions about telling stories—stories like Sarah's. The kind that grips people and tightens the knot between us and them. 

### Embedding Storytelling in Advocacy

As humans, we thrive on narratives. Filter out public relations strategies that appear scripted and stiff. Encourage your advocates to create content that speaks of real experiences interwoven with honest emotions—much like Sarah's video. Let them capture the accidental beauty of their stories, then amplify these tales. Sure, the rawness might seem daunting initially, but believe us, it's the authenticity customers crave. 

We learned that Influitive gives these stories a home, a hub, where like-minded customers gather like an impromptu book club meeting. Our gleeful discovery was like finding out brownies have fewer calories than we expected—not necessarily good for us, but oh so delightful.

## Transforming Journey, Transforming Outcomes

In this intricate machine of customer influence, each moving part becomes a force on its own—like tiny cogs in a grand clock hidden in a dusty attic. Escaping the labyrinth of figures, tables, and PDFs, we emerged to find Influitive had encapsulated the holistic view of our customer's journey, reframed through delightful interactions and shared journeys, side by side, rather than in long-winded, multi-paged PDFs that only paper-loving Greg appreciated.

### Realigning Business Objectives with Customer Experience

Our transition wasn't just about blurring conventional boundaries. Can our spreadsheet-obsessed, sunglasses-wearing Greg be regarded as a visionary? Slightly. Businesses must align objectives with nurtured experiences, transforming numbers into narratives. Customers are more than data points, they're like sprightly songbirds in a lush garden, each with tales weaves into their flights. 

Adopting Influitive meant celebrating nuanced stories—collected not to be dissected, but to be celebrated. It reminded us that transformation thrives in the authentic interconnection brought to life when we put our advocates on a pedestal.

## Influitive: Not Just a Platform, a Philosophy

We embrace the discovery that Influitive isn’t merely a tool—it’s a philosophy. It champions an ecosystem where authentic interactions happen organically, bonding customers in a symbiotic dance of advocacy and admiration. It’s a cliché, I know, but ultimately, doesn’t the destination lose its allure if the journey isn’t worth heralding?

### Paying Homage to Authentic Customer Relationships

As we reflect, sipping yet another cup of coffee, we realize, much to Greg’s satisfaction, that our relationship is not unlike a Scrabble game—challenging, redefining, and yet, always unexpectedly delightful. Through Influitive, a light dawns, illuminating pathways that transform customers into brand crusaders, steering the ship alongside us on uncharted waters.

To conclude—and not to sound like every other internet article—remember that camaraderie exists at the core of any significant journey. Bring forth genuine advocacy, and see them turn their journeys into shared ventures, one Sarah-at-a-time.
