# How to Analyze A/B Test Results in Leanplum

There we were, huddled around a dimly lit table in a tiny coffee shop, the aroma of freshly ground beans mingling with the faint chatter of early morning conversations. It was one of those rare mornings when spontaneity dictates the direction of your day. Our breaths formed small cloudy puffs as we talked excitedly about the latest experiment running on Leanplum. As we punctured our fluffy croissants—letting the buttery goodness melt in our mouths—little did we know that this ‘A/B test analysis’ would soon unravel a journey of delightful insights and rich discoveries. Fast forward to today, this narrative unravels the step-by-step guide to demystifying A/B test results.

## Discover the Magic of Metrics

Remember Julie from accounting? She had this obsession with numbers—not the dry, cookie-cutter ones—but the kind that dance around with possibilities. That was us as we dove deep into the ocean of metrics Leanplum offered. We almost saw ourselves in those numbers. The first step is akin to deciphering an ancient map—exciting, elusive, but oh-so-rewarding.

### Step 1: Log into Leanplum

We begin our treasure hunt by logging into Leanplum. Yes, the login screen is just a simple web form staring back at us with its blank expression. We type, we click, and the virtual doors open to a realm of endless data.

```
Visit: https://www.leanplum.com/
Enter your credentials
Click "Log In"
```

Now here was where the real fun began...

### Step 2: Navigate to Your A/B Test

Find the test—you remember the one, right? The campaign where we were sure we nailed the hypothesis? Leanplum neatly organizes tests within its dashboard. Locating them is like finding a book on a shelf—you just need to know the title.

```
Go to the "Campaigns" tab
Find your A/B test under "Experiments"
```

Everything was neatly categorized, as if by some fairy who organizes data as a hobby.

## Analyzing the Ocean of Data

Leap into those waves of results. Each metric—a signpost on the shore, guiding us towards the truth. This was where Julie’s knack truly shines—her eyes glistening with excitement, finding patterns where most see mayhem. We jotted down notes on napkins (because who carries notepads?), eager to decode the symphony of numbers Leanplum presents.

### Step 3: Review Key Metrics

Leanplum lays out metrics like a spectacular banquet—Conversion Rate, Retention Rate, Revenue Impact, and, of course, the enchanting Engagement Metrics. These numbers are your compasses, charts, and telescopes.

```
Select your test to view the dashboard
Examine metrics such as "Conversion Rate" and "Retention Rate"
```

Metrics told stories, whispered secrets, if you just listened closely enough. Julie always said, “Numbers don’t lie, but they sometimes have an accent.”

## Delving Beyond the Surface

We needed to dig deeper, extracting not just data, but turning it into insightful revelations. Don’t just settle on the surface—journey beneath, where insights generously reveal themselves to those who dare.

### Step 4: Compare Variant Performance

Is Variant A outperforming Variant B or vice versa? Leanplum’s dashboard holds answers, just like the old wise man at the town square, waiting to share wisdom with anyone willing to listen.

```
Select "Variant Comparison"
Analyze which variant outperforms in different metrics
```

Every variant was an unwrapped gift, offering unique opportunities to learn what users truly resonated with.

## Tugging at the Thread of Insights

We sat back, eyes twinkling like we’ve unlocked some video game achievement. “It’s not just about numbers; it’s about stories,” I mused, sharing a glance with everyone at the table. The air was thick with the promise of newfound knowledge and maybe some caffeine.

### Step 5: Examine Statistical Significance

This is where hypotheses are made or broken. Like a dramatic plot twist in your favorite whodunit, statistical significance confirms the authenticity of results. This step is not for the faint-hearted—brace for the numbers that could either crown you the hero or send you back to the drawing board.

```
Check for statistical significance thresholds
Make informed decisions based on significance level
```

The weight of this step could be felt in the earnestness of our observations, ensuring our discoveries weren’t illusory figments.

## The Sweet Reward of Insight

Was all this worth it, you ask? Leanplum offers the satisfaction of realizing you’re not just data-driven, but data-empowered! Real change is possible; those croissant-fueled mornings culminate in the fine art of making informed decisions and innovative campaign strategies.

### Step 6: Implement Learnings

Armed with newfound insights, we stride forward—optimizing and refining our approach. The data whispers the secrets, and we’re ready to embrace the lessons learned.

```
Identify key takeaways and strategy changes
Roll out successful test elements into broader campaigns
```

Creating strategies felt like being artists, painting with insights and innovations, adding hues of success to every stroke.

## Embracing the Unexpected

And so there we were, back at that little café, cradling mugs of steaming coffee, surrounded by cozy chaos, feeling almost like modern-day alchemists turning data into gold. The A/B test analysis journey—transcending mere logic and transforming it into wisdom—remains a profound, magical experience every single time.

With Leanplum in our arsenal, this ability to analyze, iterate, and innovate unfolds like a vivid narrative, capturing the essence of both discovery and decision-making. We trust this guide will aid your own ventures into the world of A/B testing, turning the mundane into magical moments of learning and growth.
