# Troubleshooting Common Issues with FullContact

You know those days when technology seems more like an unpredictable sibling rather than a well-trained assistant? Oh, let me tell you about the time my beloved contact management conundrum called FullContact took me on a whirlwind ride. One sunny afternoon, in what seemed a safe attempt to organize my burgeoning network, everything deceitfully seemed perfect. Yet, not unlike that wild plot twist in your favorite soap opera, chaos reared its head.

As a fellow tinkerer and lover of digital order, I felt compelled to create this trusty guide through the wily maze that is troubleshooting FullContact's occasional quirks. Ready your wits and wisdom, grab your preferred beverage, and let's dive deep into the joyous catharsis of problem-solving with FullContact.

## Unraveling the Mystery: Syncing Issues

Remember that time we swore syncing was a magical ritual? Yeah, it was that kind of a dance between belief and disbelief when FullContact decided it wouldn't sync my newly added contacts. I stared at the screen, willing it to process my request, but no dice. Ah, let's decode this mystery tidbit by bit.

1. **Check Your Connection:**
   Before we summon the tech fairies, ensure your device is connected to the internet. It’s like checking if there’s water in the swimming pool before you dive. Simple but vital.

2. **Restart the FullContact App:**
   It’s the panacea of tech troubles—restart it, but with flair! Quit the app fully and open it again. Think of it as gently waking a sleeping dragon.

3. **Inspect Your Sync Settings:**
   Imagine navigating a ship by starlight. Make sure you’ve got sync settings correctly aligned: `Settings > Accounts` in the app and reauthorize any account that seems suspiciously untouched by digital hands.

4. **Update or Reinstall the App:**
   There's nothing like a good update to unseat glitchy spirits. If that fails, consider uninstalling and reinstalling the app—akin to burning sage at the edges of mind-maddening mischief.

5. **Contact Support:**
   Sometimes, a seasoned guide is what's needed. Reach out to FullContact’s support team if you’re still ensnared. They’re known to dispense wisdom finely tailored to specific woes.

## Phantoms in the Machine: Duplicate Contacts

It was a crisp day when I discovered duplicate contacts had spawned like troublesome gremlins in my FullContact list. The fact that it happened just days before a major networking event added a dramatic flair that no one longed for.

1. **Use the Merge Feature:**
   FullContact, thankfully, brandishes a merge function like an elegant sword. You'll find it nestled within the app, eager to cut through the riffraff—`Contacts > Merge Duplicates`.

2. **Manual Dexterity:**
   Sometimes, a personal touch is required. Manually search those dupes and delete the superfluous ones, wielding the delete button as an ultimate incantation.

3. **Audit Your Sources: What’s Feeding the Gremlins:**
   Double, triple-check services connected to FullContact. If one's regurgitating duplicates, cease the connection—`Settings > Import Sources` and reclaim your sanity.

4. **Reauthorize Accounts:**
   Like a lapsed friendship needing rekindling, go back into `Settings > Accounts` to remove and reauthorize offending accounts.

5. **Public Service Announcement: Resist the Tedious Import Fleeting Offers:**
   If there's anything we've learned—it's to not import willy-nilly! Practice restraint, a sort of contact curation. Less really can be more.

## The Vanishing Act: Missing Contacts

Murphy's Law works in mysterious ways. Just when you desperately need to find a contact, poof—they vanish. It happened one lazy Friday afternoon when everything seemed too good to be true. Let's ensure those contacts remain faithfully present.

1. **Seek Through Filters:**
   Maybe they're playing hide and seek? Confirm the visibility settings aren’t secretly in ‘stealth mode’ by toggling filters within the app.

2. **The Logout/Login Ritual:**
   Sometimes simply by logging out and back in, the universe reverts to its intended order—math and magic combined.

3. **Examine Your Accounts:**
   Double-check configured accounts within FullContact, ensuring all pertinent ones are heartily connected. Verify through `Settings > Accounts`.

4. **Cloud Synchronization:**
   Don’t trust them, verify them. Check your cloud account via browser to ensure contacts exist virtually, too—in their ethereal state online.

5. **Collect, Don’t Hoard: Use Import Lists Wisely:**
   Double-check if imported lists contained all intended contacts and keep things sparingly concise, focusing on quality over quantity.
