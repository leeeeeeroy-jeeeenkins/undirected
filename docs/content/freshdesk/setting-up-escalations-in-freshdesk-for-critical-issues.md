# Setting Up Escalations in Freshdesk for Critical Issues

It all began in that moment of sheer panic—remember, back in July 2022? Our team was scrambling like cats at bath time. We were engulfed in an inferno of customer complaints, and those critical issues were slipping through the cracks like sand through our fingers. It was Karen, with her unparalleled gift for breaking things—I mean finding bugs—who finally called it out. “There must be a better way to escalate these things,” she said, exasperation in her voice. There certainly had to be. We stared at our computer screens like they had all the answers hidden just beneath the pixels.

## Chapter 1: Taking the First Step

Fast forward to a rainy Tuesday afternoon, when we gathered, mugs of steaming coffee in hand, around our beloved IT guy, Bob. With a toothpick dancing between his lips—a stern reminder that we were not dealing with just any ol' support issue—he promised us, "We'll get those suckers to escalate like squirrels in mating season." Yes, escalation was about to get a whole lot more serious. We were going to tame Freshdesk and make it do our bidding.

### Step 1: Navigating to the Admin Center

Our first objective was simple: find the Admin Center in Freshdesk. Sounds easy, but if you've been lost in the endless corridors of a software interface, you know the struggle. You're playing hide and seek with options and dropdown menus. But we got there eventually. Click on your profile picture (yes, that's you up there in the corner), then select 'Admin'. Voilà! We breathed a collective sigh of relief as if we'd just found an oasis in the software desert.

### Step 2: Finding the Automation Options

Next, Bob, our guide through the tech wilderness, pointed us towards the automation options. Under the 'Helpdesk Productivity' section—a name that suggests it might actually be useful!—we found 'Automations.' Click on it; the magic begins here. Within this, we settled on the 'Tickets' tab because, call me Captain Obvious, but that’s what this is all about.

### Step 3: Crafting a New Rule

Now came the part where we could flex our creativity. We clicked on 'New Rule' like it was the 'Do Not Press' button at the nuclear plant. We needed to name our rule—this bad boy was going to be the guardian angel of our critical issues. "Crit-Savers" Bob suggested, between toothpick chews. It stuck. You’ve gotta love a good name.

In the 'When an action is performed' section, we set our rule to trigger on ticket creation. Freshdesk, in its infinite wisdom, offers various conditions for rules to dance too—ah, the rhythm of automation! We selected 'Priority is equal to or greater than High' because, well, we wanted to catch the big fish.

### Step 4: Defining Actions

We weren't into being all talk, so we moved on to the 'Actions' section, setting down not one but multiple actions for Freshdesk to perform. Our primary target was to reassign the ticket—priority calls for our A-team. So, we selected 'Assign to group' and chose our best troubleshooters: the 'Firefighters'. Just imagining them wearing tiny helmets can't help but bring a smile.

Next, we assigned Bob himself to keep an eye on escalation emails. Busier than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, he agreed to the task. It was a grand moment for team accountability.

### Step 5: Testing the Waters

Oh, the anxiety of testing—akin to gently poking a slumbering dragon with a stick. We closed our eyes halfway as if bracing for impact and clicked 'Save and Enable'. Then, we created an array of dummy tickets, hoping they met our strict criteria like a nervous debutante before the queen. Each ticket neatly ascended the ranks, reaching our trusted Firefighters without a hitch. Hallelujah!

## Chapter 2: Tweaking from the Trenches

When we first set up our Freshdesk escalations, those dummies turned out to be kinder than real life.

### Fine-tuning the Beast

Mrs. Egol, the client with a never-ending list of complaints—seriously, she could've given screencasts a run for their money—helped us serve our first performance test. Her High Priority situation revealed that not all was peachy in our initial setup. As everyone scrambled to adapt, it became clear: our rules of engagement needed some tuning. Tweaking escalations is akin to tuning a vintage guitar; each string pulled makes a difference.

### Adding Conditional Firebreaks

To fine-tune our system, we ventured back into our rule settings. We went for a condition combo worthy of a math problem. 'Time since ticket created (in hours) is more than 4', ensuring no ceiling fan of fury was left to spin unchecked overnight. The Firefighters needed their rest.

### Ensuring Accountability

Then, I recall the time when Janet, our QA queen extraordinaire, suggested creating specific conditions for critical bugs—by keyword, severity, or even customer type—to make escalations tighter. It turned out to be the cherry on our proverbial escalation cake.

## Chapter 3: Checking Our Reflection

It takes a village, they say, and our village had all the quirky characters one could ask for—a place where every ticket had its moment in the limelight.

### Reviewing Escalation Performance

We regularly reviewed our Freshdesk reports. Like reading tea leaves, but with data. At our monthly "Critical Coffee Chat" with Team Firefighters, we weighed in on escalations, reviewed metrics, and shared our latest war stories. Did the wheels of our escalation train turn smoothly? Were there rogue tickets scampering off where they didn’t belong?

### Continuous Improvement

To say we weren't proud of our setup would be a bald-faced lie. But we were wise to the ways of the tech world: complacency is the enemy. Adapting and innovating became our mantra. After all, Mrs. Egol—and other equally demanding customers—loved to throw curveballs, ensuring our system never felt complete.

## Conclusion: The Grand Unveiling

After numerous coffees, tweaks, and hair-splittings—we almost thought Bob would retire his toothpick—we realized our escalations were finally a well-oiled machine. Sure, Freshdesk had taken us on quite a ride, but it was one worth taking.

From that initial, nerve-wracking sprint to our ceremonious walkthroughs and retrospectives, we had learned more about our processes, our teamwork, and how a sprinkle of tech savviness combined with human ingenuity can elevate something as mundane as customer service to a whole new plane. In the end, Karen’s exasperated outburst had served as both a wake-up call and a catalyst for what we can proudly present as an escalation process built to withstand the slings and arrows of outrageous support tickets—that critical issue generator could take a flying leap.

In the words of our stalwart team: Freshdesk will no longer be master, but an ally, in our daily customer service endeavors.
