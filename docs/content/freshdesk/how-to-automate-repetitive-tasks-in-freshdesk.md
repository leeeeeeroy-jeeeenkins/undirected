# How to Automate Repetitive Tasks in Freshdesk

Remember that moment when the coffee machine in the office broke, and we had to endure a whole day without caffeine? That relentless, dragging fatigue seemed endless. Well, that's exactly how handling repetitive tasks in Freshdesk feels if we don't automate them. It's the day I noticed Amanda, our go-to person for everything Freshdesk, looking like a zombie. That's when I knew we needed change.

## Discovering the Magic of Automation

It started with us noticing the small things—Amanda’s desk piled high with support tickets, and yet, she was handling things like a warrior. She smiled through the chaos, but we knew something had to give. There had to be a magician's trick to ease her burden. Enter—automation.

### Automating Ticket Assignments

Oh, the joy of seeing the smile on Amanda’s face when we first set up automatic ticket assignments. It was like finding an unexpected candy bar in your desk drawer. The process was surprisingly simple:

1. **Navigate to Admin Settings**: First, we made our way to the Admin under the Freshdesk dashboard—kind of like seeking out the controls of the spaceship.
   
2. **Select ‘Workflow Automations’**: Amid a sea of options, this was the beacon of hope, the lighthouse guiding us toward organizational sanity.
   
3. **Create a New Rule**: Here, we decided on triggers. We pondered, "What situations make Amanda want to scream?" New ticket creation, of course! So, we set that as a trigger.
   
4. **Define Conditions**: Yes, not all tickets are equal. Some are like tiny pebbles, others like small behemoths. We added conditions to ensure no stone, or ticket, went unattended.
   
5. **Assign Actions**: We meticulously chose which team or individual each type of ticket should be immediately sent to. It was like assigning chores, but far more satisfying.

And just like that, a chunk of Amanda’s time was freed up.

### Conjuring Automated Responses

Automated responses are the equivalent of having a clone say "I've got this" when you’re drowning under piles of requests. It’s not magic—it’s configuration.

1. **Knowledge Base Elixirs**: First, we prepared our knowledge base articles as if they were concoctions waiting to be brewed.
   
2. **Setup Automations**: Much like before, we journeyed to 'Workflow Automations'—a place we've grown fond of.

3. **Configure Triggers and Actions**: This time, we delved into common phrases like "reset password" or "forgot login", setting these as triggers to send ready-made responses.

This transformed email responses into a well-oiled machine—no more frantic typing like a caffeinated squirrel.

### The Wizardry of Escalation Rules

Certain calls for attention can’t be left in the void. Amanda once vented about an escalated issue that seemed to have slipped through cracks—the blame games were brutal. Creating escalation rules became a matter of trust and efficiency.

1. **Define the Critical**: We listed issues that were akin to having a fire drill—those that required swift action.
   
2. **Set Time-based Triggers**: Setting deadlines on responses ensured nothing sat stagnant like forgotten leftovers in the fridge.
   
3. **Notify the Titans**: Automatically alerting managers or specialized teams created this impeccable system where accountability wasn’t just a buzzword.

### Automating Routine Tasks with Freshbots

Freshbots were like these mythical creatures, bustling behind the scenes, handling grunt work. We named our bot Gary—because every cool thing deserves a name.

1. **Enable Freshbots**: First, we made a beeline to the Freshservice portal—our own little haven of control—and activated the Freshbots feature.
   
2. **Configure Task Rules**: We set specific rules for Gary to follow, things like ticket prioritization and simple troubleshooting steps.

Gary soon proved himself invaluable; he was nonstop at it—even during lunch breaks.

## Building a Future Together

Now that Amanda has shed her zombie persona (no more drooling over keyboards), we’ve realized something profound. Automation in Freshdesk isn’t just about getting things done—it's about weaving efficiency into the fabric of our operational existence. It’s like each automation script is a stitch in a vast quilt, cozying us up against the cold winds of inefficiency.

In hindsight, the experience of watching Amanda flourish after these automation tweaks was akin to successfully growing your own herb garden—the joy is immeasurable. Automating repetitive tasks in Freshdesk, after all, is not just a technical exercise. It's a lifestyle choice, an ode to efficiency, a middle finger to tedium. It's where we click away layers of unnecessary stress and watch our team bloom. And perhaps, just perhaps, it's a little bit of magic in our day-to-day operations.

With these automations and with each mug of coffee intact, our team tackled new challenges with verve and vigor. So, if you ever see Amanda these days, you’d never know she was once a coffee-deprived automaton. That's how transformative automation in Freshdesk can be—consider it your digital caffeine.
