# Advanced Google Search Console Techniques for SEO Professionals

There we were, sitting in that cozy corner café, sipping on what must have been our millionth cup of coffee that week. Our laptops humming in front of us, their screens glowing with the hopes and dreams of better search engine rankings. The usual buzz of clinking cups and muffled conversations surrounded us, but our minds were elsewhere, deeply engrossed in the mysterious world of Google Search Console. Little did we know that this tool, something most of us considered just a standard checklist tick, would turn our SEO strategies upside down—or rather, right-side up.

Back then, we took for granted how much Google Search Console (GSC) impacted our daily grind. Oh, we've read guides and seen charts, but nothing prepared us for the intricate dance we'd have with GSC—a dance not dissimilar to partnering with a particularly finicky software updated eight times before breakfast. In this article, our shared adventure will unravel advanced techniques hidden within GSC that turned our SEO compasses to true north.

## Cracking the Data Secrets: Performance Reports

Imagine this—Jerry from our team, the data buff, leaned back one day, squinting at a blinding column of numbers. "We’re missing something, I just know it," he said. And he was right. Google Search Console's Performance reports were akin to a pirate map, full of cryptic codes waiting for us to decipher.

### Diving Into Performance Reports

Before diving into the more advanced aspects, ensure your GSC account is verified and your data has cooked long enough—at least a few weeks. Why? Well, the fresher, the better, as data is like wine. Then:

1. **Open the Performance Report**: 
   - Navigate to the "Performance" tab.
   - By default, you're looking at "Web" search type, but feel free to explore Image, Video, and News.

2. **Query Filtering**:  
   - Use the "New" dropdown to filter by Query. You can see what searches you’re showing up for.
   - Play a game of Sherlock: Try long-tail keywords you can't remember optimizing for. Sometimes, the strangest queries bring traffic. 

3. **Country Drill Down**: 
   - Now, here’s where we eye-balled the globe—trends vary wildly in different regions, you know. Filter by country, then cross-reference with analytics for traffic quality correlations.

4. **Compare Date Ranges**: 
   - Toggle between date ranges to unearth trends. When Jerry spotted a surge tied to our quirky "DIY cat furniture" content, he simultaneously high-fived everyone via Zoom. 

5. **Piecing Together Impressions and Clicks**: 
   - Cross-examine clicks versus impressions and average position. Is there a high-impression, low-click query? There lies potential gold!

### Unique Insights from Anomalies

Ah, quirks. They’re the spice of any data hunt. Approach your unusual spikes with a head-scratching intrigue. That time we launched a poorly-timed April Fool's joke, which somehow led to a ranking spike—an unexpected win that became a campfire story. Anomalies might mean weird content or an influencer spotted your page. Digging into those can refine your feelers for future content strategy.

## Revamping Content with URL Inspection Tool

One lazy afternoon, we noticed Lisa frequently running the URL Inspection Tool with the vigor of an archaeologist discovering a new tomb. Curious, we peeked, and good lord, the treasures she uncovered regarding indexation and coverage issues were nothing short of miraculous.

### Efficient Use of URL Inspection Tool

Here's how we spiced up our content using those findings:

1. **Manually Inspect & Fetch URLs**: 
   - Paste your URL in the top search bar—press enter with expectation and fear—and immediately GSC tells you if it’s indexed, shoving your heart either into your throat or feet.

2. **Crowning Canonicals**: 
   - Find if the canonical URL selected by Google aligns with your preferred URL. If not, double-check your implementations and resubmit.

3. **Coverage Glitches**: 
   - Lisa once discovered a pesky “Crawled - currently not indexed” problem, leading us down a rabbit hole of content updates and sitemap resubmissions.

4. **Live Test to Debug (Use with caution)**: 
   - Press "Test Live URL" and bite your nails while it runs. The immediate feedback tells if you resolved any coverage issues post-update. Relish or groan at the results.

This technique's efficiency wasn’t just about fixing technical blunders but more about informing our whimsical strategy decisions—oh, remember the time we optimized our 90s nostalgia post with band names nobody’s ever heard of because it led to a surprisingly low competition niche? Good times. 

## Mastering Enhancement Reports

Dusting off the Enhancement tab took us on a meticulous journey—like we were detective sleuths poring over a labyrinthine case file. Mark, our in-house detective, fully equipped with a magnifying glass of course, loved dissecting these reports for page speed and mobile usability quirks.

### Drilling into Enhancements for Maximum Shine

Let's enhance our engagement by uncovering mobile-first gems:

1. **Mobile Usability Checks**: 
   - Under "Enhancements," click "Mobile Usability" to find any issues flagged by GSC. A lot of our “mobile viewport not set”—the usual culprit.

2. **Page Speed Insights**: 
   - While GSC doesn't hand you a golden ticket straight to speed paradise, its coverage clues can lead you to tools like Google's PageSpeed Insights to unravel insights and tweaks.

3. **Rich Results**: 
   - Leverage the "Rich Results" tab. Does GSC detect structured data? If yes, celebrate—the world of rich snippets opens up. If no—grab a mug of coffee and think microdata, schema.org, and JSON-LD.

## Anomaly Handling: Taking Manual Actions in Your Stride

There was the renowned Thursday, when Kelly received an ominous email regarding a manual action, stomping on our SEO zeal like rain on a parade. Mood dampened, she would recall the poetic guidance that "It’s not a problem until you’ve run out of problems," as we weaved our way through the process.

### Responding to GSC Manual Actions

When hit with a penalty, here's what we live by: 

1. **Read the Message Carefully**: 
   - Understand what you've offended in the Great Algorithm. Was it content, links, or something else entirely? 

2. **Reevaluation Steps**: 
   - Take corrective actions with patience: remove or disavow poor links, overhaul duplicate or thin content, and consider this your SEO repentance.

3. **Submit a Reconsideration Request**: 
   - Demonstrate genuine changes, not cosmetic. Explain to Google how Antelope Annie’s Budget Bakery-Link Directory was an honest oversight (or something else—be creative, but truthful).

4. **Await Review**: 
   - Then, wait. Patience is a virtue here. As long as you act sincerely, these processes tend to resolve favorably.

In the end—and gosh, isn’t this relatable?—we get to discuss, measure, and pour over data, as GSC introduced us to hidden SEO realms. We laughed, learned, sometimes cursed, always reflecting on how such a tool taught us to approach digital visibility not just as a set of metrics, but as an art form. Here in this article, we shared our trials and triumphs, so take from it what you will and apply it to your own digital tales of daring and discovery. 

To many more cups of coffee and a brighter online presence—cheers.
