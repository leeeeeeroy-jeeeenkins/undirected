# How to Use Google Search Console to Diagnose Website Issues

There was this one rainy afternoon when the internet gods decided my website should become invisible. Poof, just like that. Imagine clicking refresh on your favorite web browser a dozen times and seeing nothing but a slightly mocking 404 error. A disaster in the making, right? That day, somewhere between sipping cold coffee and muttering under my breath, I stumbled upon Google Search Console—a loyal compass for the digital wilderness. This isn't just another how-to guide; it's a tale.

And so, we gathered, not just you and I, but an entire ensemble of web enthusiasts, each ready to embark on a quest to tame the capricious website beast. So, buckle up. We're diving into the Google Search Console galaxy, an interstellar map to diagnostics, where every click might reveal glorious insights.

## Setting the Stage - The Google Search Console 

Ah, the Search Console's dashboard. It's the command center of sorts, with graphs and red buttons that scream "urgent!". Think of it like meeting an old, wise hermit who speaks only in cryptic languages - useful, but just slightly overwhelming. Imagine us gathered around an ancient artifact, one that requires careful attention and understanding to unlock its mysteries. So, here's where we begin: logging in.

**Step 1: Signing up and Logging In**

First thing’s first. You need to have a Google account—who doesn’t these days? Go to the [Google Search Console website](https://search.google.com/search-console). Enter your credentials, but don’t fret, this is friendlier than entering the Citadel of the search wizards. Once you're in, it's almost like gaining access to hidden caverns, teeming with secret data and insights about your site.

**Step 2: Adding Your Property**

Have you ever tried to claim a parcel of digital land, as if marking territory on the frontline? Click on 'Add Property' and enter your website's URL. Choose between 'Domain' or 'URL prefix'. We went with ‘URL prefix’ because sometimes playing it safe keeps the monsters at bay. You'll need to verify this, but it's no dark ritual—just upload a code, add an HTML tag, or dance through DNS settings like a modern-day alchemist.

## First Glimpse - Performance Reports 

Do you ever wish you could eavesdrop on what search engines think of your site? That's what the Performance report is for. I once found out that visitors were dancing their clicky fingers too much around a page I hardly cared about, but got potentially viral insights from the performance metrics.

**Step 3: Understanding Queries and Clicks**

Here comes the interesting part: the 'Performance' tab. Clicking here opens up a cornucopia of information. It’s like lifting the lid off a simmering pot—immediately, you're enveloped in savory stats and trends. Volatile? Sometimes. Fascinating? Always. Your queries, impressions, clicks. They glimmer before you in neat columns. The real trick is not in just viewing these but, rather, tapping into what they mean.

**Step 4: Analyzing Impressions and CTR**

Next, let's talk impressions and CTR—the bread and butter of any digital narrative. Impressions tell the tale of how often your site is considered, a listen-if-you-will narrative of visibility. If it's low, it’s like being the wallflower at a party; high CTR means you’re the life of it. Discover these metrics under Performance and dissect why some pages get all the love, while others languish in oblivion.

## Errors, Errors Everywhere 

Remember that feeling, finding out you skipped the most obvious ingredient in a recipe after it’s cooked? Errors in Google Search Console can sometimes feel like that—it’s one way Google tells us there’s something amiss, whether it’s our sitemap, or simply URLs misbehaving.

**Step 5: Clicking on Coverage**

There’s this myth - well, it may be a fact - that URLs sometimes go on a strike. Under ‘Coverage’, you discover what’s in Google’s heart about your URLs. Grapple with warnings and errors; they’re color-coded like streetlights. Unindexed pages, why hast thou forsaken us? Click on any error for a road map to what needs fixing, and while those URL monks protest, we’ll strategize their return to favor.

**Step 6: Validating Fixes**

Once we've wrestled with elephantine errors, it's time to make peace. Click on each error and choose 'Validate Fix'. It’s like a hopeful handshake after a long battle—part faith, mostly reassurance. Wait for the Search Console to signal a thumbs up, or be ready to engage if it calls us back with more red-flagged issues.

## Let’s Talk Mobile Usability

Ah, the era of mobile first. Once there, we learned that not everyone browses from a stately desktop with a mega-screen. Check under 'Mobile Usability' to see if your site throws tantrums on smaller screens.

**Step 7: Solving Mobile Issues**

One fine day, we realized the mobile version of our site required users to squint like they were decoding ancient scrolls. Clicking on ‘Mobile Usability’ gives a list of issues begging for resolution, like "Text too small to read" or "Clickable elements too close together". Fix these and validation is your nod from the cosmos.

## The Handshake with Enhancements

Structured data, rich results – these are the cherry on top of the digital sundae. Search Console offers 'Enhancements' filled with hopes for added visibility and magic. Trust us, this is worth it.

**Step 8: Exploring Enhancements**

Navigate to 'Enhancements'. If we’re lucky, this place is vibrant with possible “rich results” glory. In my case, breadcrumb issues loomed large. But once ironed out, they added more layers of wonderful texture - almost as delightful as layers in a tiramisu.

## Security and Manual Actions – Awaken the Guardians

Even the best sites sometimes find themselves locked in battle with the darker side of the web. The 'Security' and 'Manual Actions' tab guides us like a sentry light in a pirate-laden sea.

**Step 9: Reviewing Security Issues**

With 'Security Issues' and 'Manual Actions', ensure your site’s defenses are intact. Detect any threats—what a relief when there are none! But if they do cast their shadow, we arm our defenses by fixing pesky phishing pages or cleaning up hacked content.

**Step 10: Requesting Review After Manual Actions**

If caught in the web of manual actions, rise from the ashes by requesting a review once our fixes are in. It's like turning in a test, hopeful for that blessed pass mark. Cross fingers and hope for the best because we’ve armed ourselves robustly.

## Wrapping Up - A Warm Farewell

As our magical, mystical journey draws to a close, we have traversed through treacherous terrains of Search Console. Echoing through time, we now possess the wisdom to truly understand our website's conversation with search engines. Together, we’ve set forth into mysteries untold and unearthed actionable insights.

Remember, it’s never just about curing your site of its ailments. Instead, consider it a continuous journey - not just a detour past danger, but a serenade to digital balance and performance. As we ponder this, the rain beats gently - a rhythmic reminder of nature calmly conversing with the digital. Harness it, friends. Until next time, when next there are tales from the Console to share and digital adventures to embark upon.
