# Guide to Drupal 9: What's New and Should You Upgrade?

It all began on a drizzly Wednesday evening, the kind where you can practically taste the moisture in the air. I found myself knee-deep in the throes of nostalgia, accompanied by my trusty old laptop. You know the type—screen flickers threateningly, battery life akin to a mayfly's, teetering on the brink of digital retirement. I was reflecting on the whirlwind days when I first stumbled through the convoluted corridors of Drupal 7, as one does, when I suddenly realized: Drupal 9 was now strutting onto the stage with all the grace of a tech debutante.

In our ever-evolving realm of content management systems, Drupal 9 invites us to embark on an adventure—like upgrading your sword in an RPG, it's shiny, promises new magic, but leaves you questioning if the grind is truly worth it. That brought me here, to this moment, and this guide, to help us unravel the enigma of whether to embrace the prowess of Drupal 9 or linger a bit longer in familiarity’s comforting embrace.

## Unwrapping the Newness in Drupal 9

Imagine us standing on the precipice of Drupal 9’s unveiling—a digital coming-out party. Unlike previous versions, which dared us with radical tech leaps, Drupal 9 whispers familiar comforts yet promises better days. Let's break down what's spanking new and whether this upgrade deserves a firm place in our digital toolkit.

### Symfony 4 & Deprecated Code Removal

There we were, on a Zoom call, bandying about developer jargon like "Symfony x" posturing like we actually know what that means. My colleague, Sarah—the alleged wizard of frameworks—chirped in with, "Symfony 4, guys! Swift as a coursing river!"

Let's demystify that enthusiasm. Drupal 9 is built atop Symfony 4 (cue obligatory keyboard clatter), aiming for modern PHP standards while dethroning the bloat of deprecated code. Our codebase is leaner, meaner, and more forward-compatible. It's like shedding off those old college sweaters for something sleek yet comfy—still, the true cost is deciphering whether your site needs a new PHP suit.

### Updated Dependencies & Composer

Enter Composer—an enigmatic, oft misunderstood figure in our saga. An upgrade to PHP 7.3, with optional foray to 7.4, and a valuable companion is Drupal 9's way of keeping pace with contemporary codecraft. Remember that time Billy dipped his hand in hot nacho cheese? Like that miscalculated risk, ignoring Composer’s existence could scorch us later. Composer manages dependencies with the finesse of a seasoned sommelier, ensuring everything from modules to external libraries syncs harmoniously, sparing us many digital headaches or cheese burns.

#### The Tangled Web of Modules

Here’s where Darcy—my friend with a penchant for lists—would caution, "Will your UUID module sit well with the upgrade?" Consider compatibility. Before we plunge into upgrade waters, ensuring that our trusted modules know the dance of Drupal 9 alongside us is crucial. Otherwise, we could end up like that dinner party host scrambling for the perfect musical playlist. No one wants a dull, music-less CMS soirée.

```bash
composer update drupal/core --with-dependencies
```

Run the command above, while sipping a fresh coffee, to bring those modules into delightful harmony with Drupal 9. Add a pinch of customization where needed—a little tweak here, another there—and voilà! Your site should hum beautifully.

## Enjoying New Features

Upon embracing an upgrade, the first goal is reveling in its spoils. We've untangled and upgraded; it's time now to explore what joys Drupal 9 offers, hand-in-hand with our favorite users—clients and stakeholders. Here's a medley of upgrades at your doorstep.

### API-First Approach

Let's talk practicality. Drupal 9’s mother tongue is now JSON:API—a universal language for machines to foster seamless, frictionless human interactions, by proxy. I remember when Steve, our “API apostle” in the team, demoed API-first functions with a nerdy sparkle in his eyes. Trust me on this one: it lays the groundwork for headless architecture, which sounds terrifying but is really just a fancy way of saying our backend dances in partnership with any frontend.

### Cleaner User Experience

The user interface whispers sweet nothings of modernity. Functional, crisp, knotty bits pruned, and redesigned like my grandma's autumn garden. For those who dwell in the backend, Drupal 9 courts with a reimagined admin interface, proving aesthetics and usability can indeed coexist peacefully. 

There’s a lovely story I recall of Jacob who wasn’t tech-savvy yet ran his bookstore. He fiddled with the new admin UI and, eyes lighting up, pronounced it a 'jewel of joy and simplicity.’ Let's face it; if Jacob can groove to this UI, there’s hope even for those buried in bewildering spreadsheets.

## Should You Upgrade?

Here lies the soul-searching question: Is Drupal 9 your soulmate, or should you swipe left?

### Security & Longevity

Consider security—it's like an armor, yet fashionable and steadfast. Drupal 9 offers extended support with updates until end-2023, which is a siren's call to any security-focused crew. In a world where cyber-villains lurk at every fiber optic crossroad, reinforced security isn't just prudent; it's necessary.

### Future Readiness

In our tech-driven journeys, there’s a notion of future readiness. Drupal 9 serves like a time capsule, ready to transport us across tech timelines without temporal disruptions. Sarah, the futurist, often muses about aligning with tech trends, and with Drupal 9, she joyfully points out, we're already ahead of the game.

### Weighing Costs And Efforts

Rolling into the practical, it's wise to pause and weigh our expenditures—both digital and monetary. Upgrading to Drupal 9, like renovating a quaint yet creaky home, requires time and resources. From developer hours to project timelines, it’s an undertaking worth measuring.

## Concluding Whispers

As we lounge on the terrace of contemplation, watching as the digital sun dips below the horizon, there's comfort in knowing we're not alone on this adventure. Drupal 9 beckons us with open arms—offering a balance of improved performance, enhanced security, and an invitation to grow together.

Whether you choose to embrace the Drupal 9 experience now or eye its appeal from afar, remember the most important part: our digital expeditions are always better when we revel in shared stories and discovery. So, dear reader, let’s toast to more of the same—with a sprinkle of irreverence for good measure—and eagerly anticipate whatever tech marvels the future might bring our way.
