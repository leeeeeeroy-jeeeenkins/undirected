# Comprehensive Guide to Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 Upgrade

It was a rainy Tuesday afternoon, the kind that makes your coffee taste better and your socks inevitably wet. My colleague, Jenny, and I were huddled around a glowing screen, half mesmerized by the lines of code dancing like caffeinated squirrels, and half dreading the mysterious beast that was the Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 upgrade. "What's the worst that could happen?" she asked, with a hesitant optimism usually reserved for horror movie protagonists. Little did we know, this journey was less about survival and more about discovering the art of graceful transitions in the world of CMS—like migrating homes without losing your favorite mug.

## Understanding the Need for Upgrade

You see, it struck us like the realization that the leftover pizza is still in the fridge – an undeniable need to stay updated, to embrace the new. Drupal 8, while our trusty old bicycle, was due for an upgrade. Drupal 9 promised to add fanciful features, streamlined performance, and, most importantly, long-term security support. Just like trading in your beloved Yamaha for a shiny Ducati, it was both thrilling and a tad daunting. But, as Jenny liked to say, "Fortune favors those who hit the update button before end-of-life dates."

### Step 1: Preparation is Key

Our first lesson was one of diligent preparation. The old adage "forewarned is forearmed" never seemed truer. We began with a full backup of our Drupal 8 site—because nothing screams "disaster averted" like having a backup when things go south. Using Drush or whatever magical tool we preferred, we ensured we had a grasp on our current site configurations, files, and databases.

```sh
drush sql-dump --result-file=../database_backup.sql
tar -czvf ../site_backup.tar.gz .
```

This little precaution was like carrying an umbrella into the storm. Also, crucial was updating to the latest Drupal 8 version. At one point, Dave from Accounts chimed in with unsolicited wisdom, "It's like making sure your old Nokia can still text before switching to a smartphone." Never ignore the sage.

### Step 2: Assessing Contrib Modules

Next, we faced the wild west of contributed modules. This step was less about pressing buttons and more about heart-to-heart conversations with composers and maintainers. The task was grating but necessary. We armed ourselves with the "Upgrade Status" module, a tool described by some as "the Hogwarts acceptance letter" to the new school of Drupal 9.

```sh
composer require drupal/upgrade_status
drush en upgrade_status
```

We worked through the modules one by one, discussing which had ready-to-use upgrades and which were still waiting for their Knight in Shining Code—the maintainers cooking up compatibility patches. Like deciding which of your plants would survive relocation to a new apartment, it was tough but part of the cycle.

### Step 3: Resolving Deprecated Code

Here’s where things got real. We stumbled upon the delicate business of resolving deprecated code—kind of like fixing that squeaky door hinge that your roommate has learned to ignore. We ran our code through reports generated by our trusty "Upgrade Status," pinpointing code that needed refactoring or outright retirement.

Our solution involved a mix of gentle nudging and aggressive overhauls: replacing deprecated functions, tinkering with themes, and mending the CSS that brought our web world together. We leaned on Drush, not unlike relying on your favorite toolbox.

```sh
composer require drupal/deprecation-checker
drupal-check /path/to/your/module
```

### Step 4: Update Core and Dependencies

This was Jenny's moment—the pièce de résistance of our operation: updating the core and its myriad dependencies. Composer became the silent hero of our day. With a well-aimed command, the digital gears shifted and clicked into place.

```sh
composer require drupal/core:~9.0 --update-with-dependencies
```

It was here where our coffee mugs received more attention than usual—anxiety-fueled intake as the terminal window reflected its web of execution. The result was beautiful and without undue drama. But, like waking in the middle of the night feeling like you left the oven on—a degree of anxiety remained until everything was locked in.

### Step 5: Testing and Validation

Lastly, we entered the realm of testing and validation—like when you take your car for a spin after servicing. We touched every aspect of the site to ensure seamless functionality. The feeling was thrilling and akin to solving the Rubik's cube without removing stickers. Even the odd failure added color to our journey.

We leveraged Behat and PHPUnit tests to put our updates through robust checks—this phase was as much about the gut feeling as it was about quantitative metrics. By now, our confidence grew, and we celebrated small victories with virtual high-fives—because cultures grow, but celebrating the tiny wins stays the same.

### Final Thoughts: Reflecting on a Journey

As we looked back over our digital escapades that Tuesday afternoon morphed into evening—Jenny, Dave, our stubborn yet trusty code, and I—we realized this process wasn’t singularly technical; it was a lesson in adaptability. Like the rain outside, this upgrade journey taught patience and gave rise to humor in the face of hair-pulling frustration. 

Our experience upgrading Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 unfolded like a story within a story—intimate, human, exciting, and just a bit quirky. It was the afternoon that we journeyed not just from one version to another, but from apprehension to enlightenment. It was about finding joy and purpose in what seemed an insurmountable task. Maybe much like finding your wet socks amusing—oh, the little things life throws at us!

So, dear friends, as you march bravely toward your own upgrades and challenges, I hope our shared moment in this lusciously tangled, but rewarding, techno-landscape lights your path as it did ours—with warmth, adventure, and a touch of absurdity. 

Godspeed and happy upgrading!
