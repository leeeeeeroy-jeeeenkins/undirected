# Common Drupal Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

A few moons ago, Jack and I, fueled by caffeine and naïve optimism, tackled the wild world of Drupal. I still have vivid memories of our first foray into its labyrinthine interface. Hours of work evaporated in a digital fog—like trying to catch mist with a butterfly net—just because we forgot an essential step buried deep in the documentation. This story isn’t just ours; it’s a cautionary tale, a passage of rites if you will, into the realm of Drupal. Rather than let countless others stumble blindly where we did, we’ll unravel the mysteries of common Drupal foibles and illuminate the path to erosion-free deployment. Strap in and let's embark on this tale.

## The Installation Conundrum

Oh, that exhilarating moment of clicking 'install' on a fresh Drupal site. Our hopes soared like helium balloons—only to be deflated by a constellation of errors. Picture us: two bewildered souls staring at the screen, puzzled over which PHP extension was our arch-nemesis this time.

### Avoiding the Chaos

To skirt this hurdle, ensure your web server is properly configured. Here's a streamlined checklist:
- Ensure your PHP version aligns harmoniously with Drupal’s demands. For Drupal 9, PHP 7.3 or higher is a must.
- Enable essential PHP extensions: `gd`, `mbstring`, `pdo`, `dom`, `filter`, `json`, `session`, `simplexml`, among others.
- Configure the Apache rewrite module by executing:
  ```bash
  sudo a2enmod rewrite
  ```

Finally, and most critically, when you approach the installation table, double-check permissions for your `sites/default/files` directory. This move saved Jack and me countless late-night cries for help.

## Overzealous Module Deployment

Once Jack and I had successfully scaled the Installation Hill, in our hubris, we proceeded to enable every module that tickled our fancy—all at once. The result? A site as slow and incoherent as a befuddled tortoise.

### Strategy for Swift Sailing

Here’s the golden rule: don’t bet on every horse. Selectively enable modules that your site truly needs. We’ve learned that sometimes, less is more.
- Keep track of the modules you activate with a spreadsheet or a shared note—it’s easy to lose sight in the clutter.
- Regularly audit your active modules to prune any redundancies.
- Before enabling, read the module’s documentation. Some modules require additional configurations—your future self will thank you.

Navigating modules doesn't need to be a battle of attrition, more a carefully curated showcase of functionality.

## Theming Tribulations

Our next battle was against the design demons themselves. With our imaginations ever so slightly beyond our skills, Jack and I wanted a site that could rival the Tower of Pisa—except without the tilting part. Yet, our overly ambitious theme implementations led to more quirks than characteristics.

### Aesthetic Mastery without Madness

Remember, themes are about enhancement, not upheaval. Start with a base theme like Classy or Stable. Build incrementally.

```yaml
base theme: classy
libraries:
  - mytheme/global-styling
regions:
  header: 'Header'
  footer: 'Footer'
```

Implement changes in small increments. Verify each tweak doesn’t warp your site’s functionality. Dip into the wonderful world of CSS and preprocess functions—but with moderation.
- Make custom tweaks through a child theme to ensure the core remains pristine and unbroken.
- Get comfortable with Twig templates; after all, they’re the warp and weft of Drupal theming.

## Content Management Confusion

There's beauty in structured content—or chaos, if, like us, you bungle it. The realization hit us like a wayward frisbee; we needed a system to our content madness. 

### Order from Chaos

The magic words here are “Content Types” and “Fields.” Create separate content types for each different kind of information you’ll present. This sets a clear structure—a highway, if you will—through which your content can flow easily.

```json
{
  "label": "Article",
  "type": "article",
  "fields": {
    "field_text": "Text",
    "field_image": "Image"
  }
}
```

Jack and I also realized the hushed power of Taxonomies to add dynamic flexibility. And for heaven's sake, name your content types and fields consistently to prevent future migratory headaches.

## Security Slip-Ups

Once, when everything else seemed to be humming along as smooth as a jazz sax solo, we were blindsided by the villainous specter of security gaps. 

### Fortifying Your Fort

Security is not an afterthought. Always keep your Drupal and all modules up to date. Remember:
- Use [update.php](http://example.com/update.php) after each update to ensure database consistency.
- Implement strong passwords and use security modules like Security Kit and Password Policy.

On a more technical note, hone your `.htaccess` skills to hide sensitive files or directories from public browsing.

```apache
<FilesMatch "(^CHANGELOG\.txt|^INSTALL\.txt|^LICENSE\.txt)$">
  Order deny,allow
  Deny from all
</FilesMatch>
```

Together, these steps amp up your defenses and help keep peace in the digital realm.
