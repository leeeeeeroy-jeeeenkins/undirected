# Customizing Dashboards in Freshworks CRM for Better Insights

---

Two years ago, during a particularly hectic Monday morning, I spilled an entire mug of coffee on my keyboard – a true catastrophe when you've got a million tabs open and dashboards to scrutinize. The incident, while tragic for my keyboard, became a moment of serendipity. In the midst of replacing sodden keys, I found myself pondering over the cluttered chaos of my Freshworks CRM dashboard. Like a freshly brewed cup of joe, it was time for a refresh!

## Rediscovering Simplicity

Here's the thing: When everything screams for your attention, nothing gets heard – ask my poor coffee mug! So, let's talk about starting over, shall we? 

First, we need a clearing. Blank slate, zen garden, the works. Clear away everything clogging up your dashboard.

### Step 1: The Great Dashboard Declutter

I know, I know. Deleting anything feels like you're Marie Kondo-ing your workday, but trust me on this.

1. **Access your Dashboard:** Open Freshworks CRM and head to the dashboard section.
2. **Clearing the Canvas:** Remove all existing widgets. Every single one. Like trash day in a small town.
3. **Start Fresh:** With your blank dashboard, prepare to add back only what truly sparks joy (data joy, that is).

Lena from Sales will keep asking, "So when's the new widget coming?" Tell her to chill; we’re on a journey to insight Nirvana!

## Adding Back with Purpose

Jane from Marketing once said, "Data is only useful when it's seen," while probably quoting an old guru or maybe Gandalf. Anyway, the point stands. Now we selectively bring in widgets that shine a light on our path.

### Step 2: Adding Widgets That Matter

1. **Click on ** + Widget**:** You'll find this at the top right of your pristine dashboard.
2. **Choosing Widgets:** This step is both art and science. Choose widgets relevant to your goals. Revenue metrics, lead details, sales forecasts – think of them as your insightful squad, like the cast of Friends but less 90s.
3. **Set Parameters:** Click on each widget to set up parameters. Filter by time frames, territories, sales reps – whatever tickles your analytical bones.
4. **Drag and Drop:** Organize them in a way that feels intuitive. You want your eyes to dance across the screen, not trip over clutter.

## Customization Techniques

Imagine this: You're a chef in a digital kitchen. Think of these widgets as ingredients. Bringing flavor to our data stew requires some finesse.

### Step 3: Widget Customization

1. **Colors and Labels:** Use colors that help key data stand out. John – the color-blind accountant – should still find it comprehensible, so don't go overboard.
2. **Visualization Types:** Choose graphs, pie charts, bar charts – all the lovely ways to make data visual art. Pay attention to what tells the story best.
3. **Adjust Dimensions:** Tweak the size of each widget for easy reading. You don't want squinting users and sore eyes.

## Sharing the Wealth

One cold Friday morning, my fellow project manager Gary sauntered in late, his usual groggy self. He saw the new dashboard and exclaimed, “This! This makes sense!” A shared tool is a productive tool.

### Step 4: Collaboration and Sharing

1. **Sharing Options:** Click the share button to invite team members.
2. **Assign Roles:** Allow viewing or editing based on their roles. Don't give the interns too much power – remember that one time with the Excel spreadsheet?

Keep everyone in the loop, and watch collaboration blossom like spring flowers – minus the allergies.

## Continuous Tuning

A dashboard isn't a conveyor belt; it's a living, breathing entity. It grows, it learns, it evolves with our needs.

### Step 5: Regular Updates and Feedback

1. **Weekly Reviews:** Take five minutes every week – yes, just five – to review your dashboards.
2. **Solicit Feedback:** Ask your team for input, particularly those with unique needs or perspectives.

We are in this together, crafting this tool. Let's keep it relevant.

## Final Thoughts

Remember how it started? Keyboard drenched, cursing the heavens. Yet here we are, with a dashboard that feels just right. If we ever spill coffee again, it won’t be in frustration but maybe in a toast – to insights, clarity, and well-done dashboards!

So, my friends, let's relish this newfound order. Customize freely, share generously, and always keep an eye out for that next tweak. Cheers to our digital dashboards!
