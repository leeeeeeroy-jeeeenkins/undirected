# How to Migrate Your Data to Freshworks CRM

One cool autumn afternoon, I found myself at the precipice of a daunting digital migration. Our trusty old CRM had finally decided to retire, and we were ready to embrace the vibrant and efficient world of Freshworks. It felt like moving from an old apartment—where you know every squeak in the floor—to a new, sleek pad with modern amenities. But with data instead of couches. And let me tell you, migrating data is no small feat. It’s an adventure!

## Preparing for the Journey

We stood there, like explorers before a jungle of spreadsheets and potential pitfalls. The first step in our grand migration plan—identifying what goes and what stays. We had to decide which contacts and deals deserved a new home. As Marie Kondo might say, "Does this data spark joy?" Well, not joy precisely, but relevance and necessity. We needed clear skies for a safe digital transfer, so we cleaned out duplicates and organized our data with the precision of a librarian arranging first editions.

## Mapping the Terrain

Next, we had to match our old fields to the shiny new ones that Freshworks offered. It was like translating from Klingon to English (but perhaps slightly easier). Sometimes, our old data fields and Freshworks weren't speaking the same love language, so we tweaked and adjusted until they did. Picture matching puzzle pieces—awkward at times, but oh so satisfying when they fit perfectly.

## Embarking on the Migration

With everything prepped and primed, we took the leap. We used the data import option in Freshworks to start our migration. Select. Upload. Pray. Watching the progress bar felt like waiting for bread to rise—agonizingly slow, but ultimately rewarding. The anticipation was palpable as we clicked "Import," imagining our digital lives neatly boxed up and sent on their merry way.

## The Hiccup—a Story of Perseverance

Like any good story, ours had its twist. Midway through, our internet connection decided to play pranks—disconnecting right when things seemed to be smooth sailing. My heart skipped a beat, but then we laughed. What’s an adventure without obstacles? With a trusty backup spreadsheet and a strong Wi-Fi signal reestablished, we resumed—and finished. The feeling was akin to finding extra fries at the bottom of a fast-food bag. An unexpected delight!

## Settling into Freshworks

Once the migration was complete, the real fun began: customizing our Freshworks CRM to fit our needs like a well-tailored coat. We fiddled with settings and discovered features that seemed tailor-made for us. Automation here, integration there—it was like exploring a new city and finding the best little café on the corner. 

## Reflecting on our Journey

Looking back, migrating our data wasn't just a mundane digital task. It was an opportunity to revisit and reassess how we interact with our information and clients. We emerged not just with a new CRM, but with a deeper understanding of our needs and processes. 

As we sip our coffee, comfortably settled into Freshworks, we wonder why we didn’t do it sooner. Perhaps, like in all migrations, the journey—the discoveries, the mild panic, the laughter—is just as important as the destination. So, fellow adventurer, are you ready to embark on your own migration journey?
