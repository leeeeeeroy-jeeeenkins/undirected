# Managing Contacts and Accounts in Freshworks CRM

I remember it clearly, like it was yesterday. We were at Sarah's kitchen table, coffee brewing, surrounded by a mountain of business cards and not an ounce of organizational strategy between us. Our little startup was gaining traction, and with it came the delightful chaos of numerous contacts and potential accounts. That’s when the suggestion to try Freshworks CRM hit like a lightbulb moment. It wasn’t that we were disorganized folks; we just needed a better system. Everyone does at some point, right?

## Taking the First Steps

Freshworks CRM became our beacon of order. Like trying to fit chaos into neat little boxes—but make it digital and smart. Initially, we wondered if it was one of those cookie-cutter scenarios where you give up mid-way, but no, this felt intuitive. Hence, let's plunge deeply into how we tamed our contact beast.

**First, the Contact List Dashboard!**

It was love at first click. Opening the dashboard was akin to opening my grandma's treasured recipe book, yet instead of recipes for cookies, it was all our important contacts laid out in a digital landscape. It gave us an instant overview. Straightforward, clear—a mosaic of names, companies, emails; people we knew, and those we wanted to know.

**Adding Contacts, like a Pro**

With a determination second to none—and possibly fueled by too much caffeine—we explored adding new contacts. Click on "New Contact." Enter the details. Save. Voilà, it was like magic, only less magic and more, "Oh, that was easy." It even allowed importing contacts from spreadsheets, which made our fingers quite happy by saving them a lot of typing.

## Segmenting and Organizing: Our Friend, the Tags

Our excitement over tags was hilarious now that I think about it—grown adults excited over digital sticky notes. But these aren’t just ordinary tags. Have a client who loves cat memes? Tag ‘CatLover’. A potential deal that’s critical? Tag ‘HighPriority’. These allowed us to personalize and streamline interactions and when we discovered automation...well, that's a whole different slice of cake, isn't it?

**Creating Account Profiles**

It didn’t end with contacts. No way, Jose. We delved into account profiles next, which meant grouping contacts under one umbrella company—much like putting all the family photos into one big album organized by date, events, and sometimes, sheer favoritism.

## Keeping It All Together with Views

Who knew that customized views could become the darling of our productivity toolkit? Categorizing contacts under custom filters felt like organizing a vinyl collection alphabetically; pure joy and satisfaction. By the time our filter system was down pat, Sarah even suggested we do the same for the spices in the kitchen. New task, new day.

## Closing Thoughts

Looking back now, managing contacts and accounts in Freshworks CRM was less of a chore and more of an expedition—a journey we undertook at that little kitchen table, complete with coffee rings on the dashboard printouts as proof of our conquests. It became a storyteller of our startup’s growth, one contact at a time, and taught us how a beautiful chaos could transform into finely tuned harmony. Our kitchen table meetings continue, but now, instead of taming wild business cards, we strategize on, cozy and chaotically organized in our warm, coffee-scented sanctuary. Here's to the digital chronicles of order and camaraderie.
