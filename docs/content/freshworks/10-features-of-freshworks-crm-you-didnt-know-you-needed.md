# 10 Features of Freshworks CRM You Didn't Know You Needed

I remember the first time Clara cornered me with a question about moving our small tech start-up to a new CRM system. It was over coffee – ironically, because caffeine usually signals peace not panic. Clara had that look in her eyes, the one screaming "We need something better," while holding a steaming cup that read, "World's Best CEO." 

It was a time when we were scaling, not like a nimble climber but more like a frenzied herd of cats. Our old CRM was just not up to speed – scattered and often moody like a grumpy uncle. Naturally, curiosity led us to Freshworks CRM, which was like finding a Swiss Army knife in a sea of rusty bolts. Little did we know, it had hidden gems we never knew we needed.

## 1. AI-Powered Lead Scoring

The first aha moment was discovering the exquisitely astute AI-Powered Lead Scoring. Unlike Dan, our sales manager, who ranked leads based on gut feelings and dice rolls, the AI quietly sifted through data, identifying our best bets with uncanny precision. It’s like having a psychic octopus subtly guiding your sales process, minus the festival of tangles.

## 2. Visual Sales Pipeline

Imagine trying to explain a complex sales process using interpretive dance – that’s how chaotic our pipeline used to feel. Enter the Visual Sales Pipeline, a feature that transformed our confusion into concise visual bliss. It turns rows of numbers into a symphony of charts and bars, almost like coaxing a stubborn orchestra into harmony. Here, the chaotic dance became an organized waltz, each step leading us closer to the deal's grand finale.

## 3. Freddy AI - Your Personal Assistant

Then came Freddy AI, our tireless ally. Think of him as that nerdy friend who knows when to remind you about meetings without being pushy – a true gem in the virtual assistant world. Freddy slyly keeps track of tasks, meetings, and even offers witty insights, providing a sense of organization akin to having Master Yoda whisper strategies into our ears. Without the mud and robes, naturally.

## 4. Customizable Dashboards

Dashboard dilemmas plagued us for ages, much like rearranging furniture in a tiny apartment. Thankfully, Freshworks allows customization – each team member could craft a dashboard as unique as their coffee preferences. It’s like having each cubicle in the office tailored to individual productivity styles, pulling everything necessary into focus. Turning chaos into coherent efficiency, one widget at a time.

## 5. Journey-Based Workflows

Journeys, much like road trips, are all about the experience. Freshworks gave us Journey-Based Workflows, the equivalent of replacing boring traditional maps with a GPS system that can alter routes on the fly. We tailored our customer journeys, creating bespoke paths for every unique client. Each interaction felt purposeful, meaningful – no geographical skills required, just clever automation.

## 6. Omnichannel Communication

Remember those chaotic scenes in war rooms on television? Where information is shot across different channels, and somehow people are supposed to understand the crossfire? Omnichannel Communication swooped in like a true diplomat. Now, whether it’s email, chat, or smoke signals, it consolidated customer interactions into one coherent stream. The chaos lifted, and I swear we could hear an angelic choir in the distance, harmonizing to the beat of clarity.

## 7. Predictive Contact Scoring

One quiet afternoon, as Ben was considering if he should contact the Smith account again or not, Predictive Contact Scoring nudged him like an intuitive cat. Analyze, predict, and make suggestions – what he couldn't have done alone was effortlessly executed. It’s like having a seasoned adviser tweak a violin to perfection.

## 8. Deal Insights

Every deal was once akin to a black hole of mystery – who was doing what, when, and how? We rode blindfolded rollercoasters through negotiations. Deal Insights offered transparency that we didn’t know was possible. We could see the entire history of interactions like reading an engaging novel, brimming with drama, suspense, and thankfully, happy endings.

## 9. Reports and Analytics

Remember being a teenager stuck knee-deep in math class? Those unreadable numbers scrawled across chalkboards? Freshworks’ Reports and Analytics took those numbers, dressed them up in tidy suits, and made sense of that madness. Patterns emerged and decisions, once regrettably shot in the dark, became purposefully precise.

## 10. Third-Party Integrations 

Finally, there were those third-party integrations – enchanting bridges connecting us to external colonies in the CRM universe. Imagine Flow, Slack, and Salesforce, all holding hands, ready to share secrets seamlessly. It’s the digital version of a school reunion where everyone gets along – a blessed rarity but here it works splendidly.

As we sipped the last of our coffee that day, devices glowing warmly despite the caffeine adrenaline, we realized the surprising power we held. Freshworks CRM had become not just a tool, but an adventure of discovery filled with 'Aha!' moments worthy of sharing over more cups of coffee. 

Now, every time we dive into that realm, it feels less like work and more like orchestrating a masterpiece with features we didn’t know we needed, but now can’t live without.
