# Using Freshworks CRM to Manage Service Requests

You know that feeling when you walk into your favorite coffee shop, the barista already knows your order and greets you with a smile? There’s just something magical about being known, about not needing to repeat yourself. That's kind of what it felt like when we first started using Freshworks CRM to manage our service requests at our company. 

I'll never forget the epiphany. It was a Monday morning, and Monsour—our self-proclaimed spreadsheet whisperer—was already buried neck-deep in Excel agony. With a sigh that could probably power a wind turbine, he muttered, "There has to be a better way." And thus, the great Freshworks CRM adventure began.

## The Day the Juggling Act Ended

Have you ever tried to juggle while riding a unicycle? No? Good, neither have I. But managing service requests without a sturdy CRM felt pretty much on par with that.

Monsour and I started by diving into the user-friendly interface of Freshworks CRM. The dashboard was like a sunny day at the beach—all clear skies and straightforward horizons. 

Here’s how we started:

1. **Set up Your Freshworks CRM Account**  
   This was a breeze. Sign up, enter your details—name, company, email, the usual suspects—and kaboom, you're in. A few clicks, and Freshworks already felt like an old friend.

2. **Customize Your Dashboard**  
   Think of it as arranging your living room. Drag-and-drop functionality made it a snap to tailor what we saw first. Monsour set up his view to track incoming requests, while I focused on response times and customer happiness levels.

3. **Add Your Service Requests**  
   Uploading our existing service requests was akin to moving into a new, meticulously organized house from a hoarder’s den. We had CSV files that looked like they had survived the apocalypse. Yet, the import tool handled it beautifully, making us look much more competent than we actually were.

## Working Some Magic

Remember how Merlin whipped up spells effortlessly? Using Freshworks CRM felt a bit like that—minus the pointy hat. Maybe.

In no time, we were assigning service requests to team members with all the fuss of writing a sticky note. And guess what? Automated responses ensured our customers didn’t feel like they were sending their queries into the void. It was like discovering that the light socket you'd been banging your head against was actually a switch all along.

4. **Automate Routine Tasks**  
   Robot butlers aren’t a thing yet, but workflow automation is. Freshworks let us create so-called “rules” (sounds more imposing than it is). We drafted rules for everything: Assigning tickets based on keywords, sending follow-up emails, even booking reminders.

5. **Smart Insights**  
   Picture this: Nina, our data enthusiast, discovered she could pull analytics on request resolution times and customer satisfaction rates without needing a doctorate in astrophysics. Suddenly, our weekly meetings went from guessing games to strategy sessions.

## The Customer is Always Right

Except when they're wrong. But—look—keeping them happy is key. Freshworks had this nifty feature called “Customer 360,” which gave us a full view of each customer’s history like we were orchestrating a relationship from a rom-com script.

6. **Customer 360 View**  
   It's kinda like being a psychic. We could see past conversations, previous issues, and even personal preferences. So, when a returning customer showed up with a new request, we were like, “Ah, I see you’ve had this issue before. Let's take care of it.”

## A Revelation in Service Request Management

By the end of our first month using Freshworks CRM, it felt like we’d been given a backstage pass to the concert of service excellence. Cue the slow-mo high-fives and confetti cannons.

And Monsour? He hasn’t touched a spreadsheet for service requests in weeks. He occasionally looks up from his desk, eyes twinkling, as if he’s rediscovered the joy of working—which, in itself, is nothing short of a corporate renaissance.

So, next time you’re drowning in service requests, just remember: There's a Freshworks CRM-shaped lifeboat ready to rescue you. Trust us, it’s like finding out your unicycle comes with training wheels.
