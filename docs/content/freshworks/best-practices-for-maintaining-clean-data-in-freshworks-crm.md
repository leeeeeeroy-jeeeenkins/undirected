# Best Practices for Maintaining Clean Data in Freshworks CRM

I remember the day vividly—Margie, our office manager, had just returned from her maternity leave, and the whole team was gathered around her desk, excitedly sharing updates. She quickly logged into Freshworks CRM, and her face fell. The data was a tangled mess of duplicate entries, misspelled names, and outdated contact info. That chaos became our collective headache, one that we'd battle together. We laughed about it later, but at the time, it was a real nightmare. Over time, we sculpted that chaos into clarity, and I'm here to share those hard-won lessons on keeping your CRM clean.

## **Understanding the Importance of Clean Data**

One thing became clear as Margie’s eyes scanned the screen—unclean data messes with our productivity and sanity. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack when the stack is full of needles of different sizes and colors. It’s crucial to start with a clear understanding of why clean data matters. It’s the lifeblood of your CRM, fueling every interaction and decision.

Think of old Aunt Mabel at family dinners—her stories only make sense when her facts are straight. The same goes for our CRM. Our customer relationships prosper when data is accurate and up-to-date.

## **Prevention is Better Than Cure**

That next week, we huddled like planners before a grand heist, only our mission was simpler: stop the mess before it started. One bright idea was to implement data validation at the entry point. Freshworks CRM lets us set specific fields as mandatory, ensuring that no record can slip through without providing the essentials.

Remember Hank from accounting? The guy who’d always ask for the deadline after it passed? Not anymore. We created rules to validate phone numbers and email formats, preventing his usual slip-ups. And we only let specific team members edit certain fields, maintaining a consistent dataset. Less hands, fewer chances to muck it up.

## **Regular Data Hygiene Checks**

Our bi-weekly ‘Data Hygiene Meetings’ became part of the culture—just like our Friday donut runs. During these sessions, we’d run data audits. It sounds fancy, but it’s really just checking for duplicates, incomplete records, and inaccuracies. Margie had an eye for these; she’d sweep through the database like a data detective, spotting errors no one else could.

Freshworks CRM was our ally here, providing built-in tools to merge duplicates and delete the redundant. But we’d add a bit of human touch, verifying questionable entries with a quick call or email.

## **Segmenting and Standardizing Data**

Our CRM, once a jungle of disarray, began to resemble a well-tended garden. We achieved this by segmenting our data. Teams created specific lists based on criteria like job title, industry, and purchase history. These segments helped us target our communications more effectively and kept our database more navigable. 

We also standardized the input formats. Dates followed the same format (goodbye to 12th March 2022 and March 12, 2022 confusion!), titles were consistent, and company names were unified.

## **Training the Team**

No system, no matter how well-designed, works if the team isn’t on board. We held informal training sessions—some might call them mini-parties with a learning agenda. Margie would share tales of CRM mishaps—like the time a lead was lost in a spelling error abyss. These stories, shared over pizza, made the team more vigilant.

By getting everyone involved, we cultivated a sense of ownership. Everyone knew that clean data wasn’t just an IT issue; it was a collective responsibility.

## **Leveraging Automation**

Finally, we embraced automation like never before. Freshworks CRM's workflow automations became our best friends. They performed routine tasks like updating records and sending reminders. It was like hiring an invisible assistant who never needed coffee breaks.

Steve, our tech-savvy intern, had this brilliant idea to integrate CRM with other tools. Automations pulled data from email sign-ups, website forms, and even our e-commerce platform, ensuring our CRM stayed updated without manual input—saving us time and reducing errors.

## **Continuous Improvement**

Even now, we regularly revisit our practices. What worked last year might need tweaking today. Just like Margie's last-minute adjustments to her apple pie recipe, our strategies evolve. Staying flexible and keeping an eye on the latest updates in Freshworks helps us maintain that pristine data state.

The journey from chaos to clarity isn't easy, but it’s worth it. Clean data doesn't just make life easier; it hones our insights and strengthens our relationships. So, let’s treat our CRMs like our most cherished possessions—keep them clean, organized, and ready for whatever comes next.

And remember, when Margie smiles at the screen now, it’s because of those same practices we’ve shared today. From one data warrior to another, let’s continue the battle with pride and precision.
