# How to Perform Behavioral Targeting with Optimizely

### The Coffeehouse Revelation

Let me take you back to a nippy Wednesday afternoon, somewhere in a dimly lit coffeehouse corner wedged between the aroma of freshly ground cocoa beans and relentless tapping sounds of keyboards. We were huddled over a laptop, my colleague Max and I, our eyes glued to the screen where a graph showed a stubborn line refusing to budge upwards. Conversion rates. A distant utopia. We sipped our lattes - because caffeine is like a magic potion for marketers - while puzzling over how to entice the evasive online shoppers. That's when the neon-splashed idea bulb above Max's head flashed to life. "Optimizely!" he proclaimed with vigor, probably causing a few heads to turn our way amidst hushed sips and whispers. "Behavioral targeting," he added with a mischievous twinkle.

Suddenly, it felt like we were characters in an unremarkable novel who had just stumbled upon a plot twist. As crisp as the late autumn air outside, it breathed life into our campaign and perhaps our hope. So, with resolute nods, we embarked on the quest to master behavioral targeting using Optimizely.

### Bridging the Gap: Understanding Behavioral Targeting

Fast forward a few days, and Max had commandeered the whiteboard back at the office - armed with colorful markers and enthusiasm. “Behavioral targeting,” he began, underlining the words as if they were the essence of life itself, "is all about connecting the dots between our customers' behavior and their desires." It sounded simple as pie in theory, right? But much like assembling a piece of IKEA furniture, the devil, as they say, is in the details. Personalization is king, queen, and the entire kingdom of marketing, we believed. We had to get it all right to build trust and boost conversions.

Imagine knowing someone so well you could predict their every move - foreseeing a sneeze, a yawn, or even a penchant for impractical kitchen gadgets at two a.m. Well, behavioral targeting feels pretty similar - understanding user behavior, discerning their interests, and tailoring experiences in an eerily perceptive manner.

### Step One: Setting the Stage

Back to our adventure. First things first, Max and I realized that we needed to dive headfirst into Optimizely. "Think of it like speed dating," Max chuckled as we created an account. Each section, each setup step was like getting to know Optimizely better. We clicked through, setting it up for our website. Easy as pie, except when it wasn’t, because who doesn't love troubleshooting technical woes?

With laser-like focus, let’s begin. Go to Optimizely’s website and register for an account. Once you’re in, the dashboard welcomes you like an old friend with its user-friendly layout and a promise of insightful discovery. The interface is beguilingly simple, yet a treasure chest for the adventurous marketer. Next, connect your website through the platform. This begins the beautiful process of data collection - the essential breadcrumbs for our digital Hansel and Gretel journey.

### Step Two: Identify the Patterns

Now, with Optimizely set up, coffee cups abandoned, we delved into the data. The tools to track and measure user behavior lay sprawled out like toys in a sandbox, just waiting to be picked up. “This feels like Sherlock Holmes work,” Max whispered in conspiratorial tones as data patterns unveiled themselves. We nodded sagely at graphs like seasoned detectives sizing up a lead and plotted our next moves. Identifying pivotal patterns in behavior is crucial. 

In Optimizely, access the 'Audiences' section. Here, you create behavioral segments through a magical mix of conditions and criteria - page views, clicks, geography, and a whole menagerie of bewilderingly insightful metrics at your disposal. Choose wisely, like a kid with a limited carnival allowance picking only the most jaw-dropping rides.

### Step Three: Crafting the Experience

Ah, the pièce de résistance - creating tailored experiences. Emulating the culinary precision of Gordon Ramsay, we meticulously crafted variations that would resonate with our audience - each crafted change aimed at engaging specific user segments. In Optimizely, we ventured into the 'Experimentation' segment, plotting variations akin to secret recipes - or mischief, if you ask Max.

Change, tweak, and experiment. It’s a free-for-all here, as you A/B test different versions, taking into account the behavior identified earlier. Imagine each click of “create new variation” akin to tuning a violin, testing the strings delicately until the melody achieves a pleasant harmony.

### Step Four: Analyze and Iterate

And so, we play the proverbial waiting game - because data needs time to marinate for insights to be seasoned to perfection. When the right amount of time has passed, there, in Optimizely, awaited our results like a deconstructed puzzle begging to be pieced together again. Gather around! It's time for an exercise in patience and analytical know-how.

With hearts pounding like an EDM concert, we analyzed performance metrics. Optimizely offers visual reports - use them with the eagerness of a kid with a new calculator in math class, because numbers, patterns, and comparisons will ultimately guide decisions. Measure, evaluate, and strategize further iterations based on what's uncovered. The love affair with analytics, as we found out, is rightfully intense and fruitful.

### Tying Up Loose Ends

Our campaign saw a sparkle of upward momentum. Conversion rates were climbing ever so slightly, like a timid squirrel venturing closer to an elusive nut. It wasn’t Hogwarts-level magic, but the pragmatic reality of leveraging data-driven insights with introspection and adaptability.

Sitting on that same coffeehouse table but with more gusto, Max and I celebrated with cappuccinos raised high. “Let's remind ourselves,” Max mused, “that every step is an opportunity to dig deeper.” It dawned on us, as deeply as it can after several cups of expresso - marketing, at its core, is a continuous dialogue between understanding and innovation.

Ultimately, behavioral targeting with Optimizely evolves as we do, an ongoing story authored by our unique insights. It's less about bursts of genius and more about rhythmic, iterative mastery - pivoting as insights emerge, embracing it all with curiosity and open arms. We have this far. We can only go onwards and upwards!

Here, in the lively chaos of marketing - where art meets science over pints of inspiration - we stood united with our new-found understanding. Who knows the heights behavioral targeting will propel us to next? Certainly, it’s a story for another day, but until then, carry on with spirited tenacity. 

Happy targeting!
