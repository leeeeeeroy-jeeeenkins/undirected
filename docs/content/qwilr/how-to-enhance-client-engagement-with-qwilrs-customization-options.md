# How to Enhance Client Engagement with Qwilr's Customization Options

There was this one time, right? Right in the middle of a Monday afternoon glow, I sat there on my creaky office chair, staring at the computer. It was one of those classic moments where you simultaneously hate and love technology. My coffee was lukewarm, and my brain was fogged with that perilous post-lunch lull. Enter Qwilr. 

Now, if ever there was a tool designed for someone with a penchant for both creativity and laziness (hey, I’m honest), Qwilr was it. Yet, as I dived into its ocean of possibilities, I realized, with some horror, that all this customization might lead me deeper into my caffeine deficient stupor unless I figured out how to make it work for us rather than against us. And maybe, just maybe, in the process, we could charm our clients, too.

## Starting with the Basics: A Friendly Dashboard Greeting

Our first obstacle? Decoding the Qwilr dashboard. I remember thinking it looked strangely like my grandmother's living room - unfamiliar yet oddly comforting. There was too much to see, too much to organize, like mismatched furniture after years of collecting, but finally, here, we had to make it work.

So, if you're in the same boat, or perhaps even a kayak (let’s keep it buoyant), let's take a moment to look. The dashboard is where magic begins. Start by logging into Qwilr. Once you’re in, you’ll see the ‘Create New’ button on the right. Hit it. You’ll be presented with a range of templates that serve as a canvas, because, after all, a blank page is intimidating unless you're Shakespeare. Choose one that sings to you like a karaoke night at your local pub.

## Crafting Our Story: Embedding Videos and Accents of Interactivity

Now, one of our projects involved presenting our ideas for a new client proposal, reminiscent of a tension-filled reality show bake-off. It was all vanilla with a pinch of cinnamon - until we realized we could sprinkle in some video magic.

To embed a video, go to the block section of your chosen template. Select ‘Video Block.’ This is where you let the creativity tide take you. Upload or link to your videos from YouTube. It’s like tossing a pebble into a digital pond, and the ripples, oh the client delight!

For us, embedding videos wasn't just about being fancy; it was about telling a story, sharing a narrative - like inviting someone into a well-told secret, a whisper that promises more. It helps keep our clients hooked, engaged, and less likely to slip into a digital slumber.

## To Infinity and Beyond: The Power of Custom Fonts and Colors

At some point, during another round of customization bliss (or madness, depending on your view), I wondered what was the point of all these fonts and colors? It felt like choosing between flavors at an ice cream stand - but you know what? Fonts tell a tale; colors evoke emotions. They aren’t just accents; they’re the essence.

Changing fonts and colors in Qwilr? Simple, almost scandalously so! Click the ‘Settings’ icon on the top bar, navigate to 'Brand settings,' and oh, look—it’s your personal Alice in Wonderland rabbit hole. By adjusting those dials, we connected with our brand’s voice, making sure every detail reflected who we were – bold, but not brash, innovative, but always approachable.

## Immortalizing the Impressions: Custom Forms and Client Response

Remember when people used paper forms? I once went to a grocer in small-town summer where the cashier still used a ledger. But we're not there anymore. Custom forms in Qwilr help clients express joy and confusion in one seamless interaction, kind of like a perfect summer's day.

Navigate to your page, or proposal, or whatever glamorous project you have. Click ‘Add Block’ and select ‘Form Block.’ Design a form that asks the right questions – not like an awkward first date, but rather, a conversation with an old friend. Through these custom forms, let’s find out more about our clients than just their last Starbucks order.

## Cherry on Top: Surprising Clients with Price Blocks

Ah, the price block, the little deviant. I remember the first proposal we ever sent with these price blocks. Imagine the client’s delight, as if they’d just discovered an uncharted island. Sure, prices and delight are rarely companions, but here we concocted magic.

To sprinkle in those price options, tap into the ‘Add Block’ option again and this time, choose ‘Quote Block.’ Et voilà! Here clients choose their adventure, armed with knowledge and choice, empowering and frankly, spectacular. 

So there we were, a tiny team, ready to conquer the digital landscape, making our proposals not just pretty, but a sweet jazz medley. We didn’t just customize for the sake of it; we breathed life into our content, engaged our audience on a deeper level, and discovered that maybe, on a Monday afternoon glow, aided by Qwilr, we would go on to weave stories and connections that, hopefully, would outlast our caffeine supply.

To be honest, it was almost as satisfying as solving a Rubik’s cube. Almost.
