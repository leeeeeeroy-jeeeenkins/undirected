# How To Integrate Qwilr With Your Existing Tools

It all started on a Tuesday afternoon when we were two cups of coffee into an otherwise lackluster day. Josie and I, with our hair in a tangled state of morning chaos, bravely ventured into the tangled web of digital integrations. Our company decided to shake up how we managed proposals. Enter Qwilr—shiny, new, and a little bit intimidating, like the first day of high school all over again.

## Finding the Secret Passage: Navigating the Qwilr Dashboard

Right from the moment we logged in, we were like explorers stepping into an uncharted jungle, armed with spreadsheets and endless curiosity—our hearts racing, not entirely sure what we’d find.

1. **Enter the Qwilr Portal**  
    We logged into Qwilr using our trusty email and password. It was like walking into a new café, our senses tingling with the smell of possibility—and maybe some digital pastries if we imagined hard enough.

2. **Scout the Settings**  
    Finding our way to the settings felt like finding the passage to Narnia, only without a wardrobe. We looked in the top right corner for the little gear icon—always a friendly symbol where mystical settings live.

3. **API & Integrations**  
    In the settings, we stumbled upon the ‘API & Integrations’ section. It glimmered like a hidden treasure in a riddle-filled quest. This is where our journey started getting exciting, the land where potential meets reality.

## Meeting the Allies: Syncing with Slack

Now, Josie and I have opinions on Slack. It’s like the coworker who never sleeps but knows everyone’s business. We knew it was going to be our first ally.

1. **Find the Slack Integration**  
    We clicked on 'Connect App'—I promise it was intuitive, no magic spells needed—and hunted for Slack through the list of possibilities.

2. **Grant Permissions**  
    Clicking ‘Add to Slack’ prompted a permission page. We clicked ‘Allow’ like it was the button that would order pizza to our desk but instead it connected the apps.

3. **Set Notification Preferences**  
    Customizing notifications so they didn’t ping us into madness was crucial. We chose to receive alerts and updates that mattered, like when projects were opened or viewed—the need-to-know stuff.

## Wrestling the Gmail Beast: Email Magic

Josie and I embarked upon Gmail integration with a sense of trepidation. Email is the beast we couldn’t live without and yet wanted to tame.

1. **Locate the Gmail Connection**  
    Back in the 'Connect App' section, we typed ‘Gmail’ into the search bar with hope in our hearts. Boom, found it—child’s play.

2. **Authorize the Google Account**  
    Granting Qwilr access felt like sharing our little digital world but necessary for our dream of seamlessness. Signed in with our company Google account.

3. **Embed and Share**  
    What’s wonderful is how we could directly email Qwilr pages via good ol’ Gmail, like the synergy of pen and paper but digital—inviting colleagues and clients into our Qwilr-crafted wonders.

## Conquering CRM Giants: Embracing HubSpot

HubSpot, with its labyrinth of customer information, was our next mission. Qwilr’s thoughtfulness made us feel like it was a match written in the stars.

1. **Finding HubSpot Integration**  
    We navigated to ‘Connect App’ area once more, searched for 'HubSpot,' and voila—it greeted us like an old friend from summer camp.

2. **Authorize HubSpot Access**  
    Logging into our HubSpot account through Qwilr, we clicked 'Connect.' It was the kind of moment you capture in a scrapbooking app—a digital hug between two giants.

3. **Exploring Integration Options**  
    HubSpot and Qwilr now acknowledged each other. We could sync contacts and deals, pulling information and pushing back proposals with the grace of a ballroom dance.

## Overcoming Obstacles: Zapier to the Rescue

Zapier was like our Swiss army knife—the multipurpose, all-knowing tool in our digital backpack.

1. **Find the Zapier Integration**  
    As always, we ventured into ‘Connect App,’ typing 'Zapier’ with fingers crossed. Spotting it made us feel like seasoned adventurers.

2. **Set Up Triggers and Actions**  
    With Zapier, we played God—or at least felt like it. We connected other apps (like Trello) by setting triggers when actions happened in Qwilr.

3. **Customize Automation**  
    We crafted Zaps that automated the mundane—invoices sent, follow-up reminders, the works. Like having a digital assistant without the awkward lunchroom small talk.

## Final Reflections: When Tools Become Extensions

After all the integrations, Josie and I sat back in our chairs, a duo who had chartered the unknown and emerged victorious. If our choice to integrate Qwilr into our digital workflow maintained any analogy to the tangled hair we started the day with, it had smoothed into sleek, effortless efficiency. 

From combating chaos with Slack to whispering secrets through Gmail, we unraveled the complexities with courage and maybe a bit of grace. Our patchwork quilt of digital tools had blossomed into a cohesive masterpiece. 

So, here’s to adventure—and the digital companions that make it all worthwhile. Sure, it’s a digital landscape out there, but with the right tea and a good playlist, we’re ready for our next escapade. Happy integrating, friends.
