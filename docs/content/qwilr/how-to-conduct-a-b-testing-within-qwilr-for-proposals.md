# How to Conduct A/B Testing within Qwilr for Proposals

Gather around, dear readers. Let me tell you a tale—a tale about one fine morning, not so long ago, when I found myself sitting on the creaky swivel chair of introspection. In front of me, a blank Qwilr proposal page stared back, radiating pure potential, yet silently mocking my indecision. I had proposals to send, but a single thought kept pulsing through my mind: **A/B testing**. Can it be done on Qwilr? Oh, but it must be, and if so, how? Therein lies our quest, one we shall embark on together.

## What the Heck is A/B Testing Anyway?

Before we dive headlong into the wild world of Qwilr, let's take a moment to peruse the concept of A/B testing. Picture it: two versions of your proposal pages, identical in all respects but one tiny, variable thing—what color the button is, the way you phrase your pitch, perhaps even what complimentary coffee you mention. Version A versus Version B, locked in a showdown for supremacy. All in the pursuit of boosting conversions, engagements, or just plain 'ol curiosity.

And there was me, vibrating with anticipation to unearth which version captured more hearts and minds. Like a modern-day alchemist, we transform the mundane tin of data into gleaming nuggets of insight.

## Setting Up Our A/B Test in Qwilr

So, there I was, heart pounding like I'd just witnessed a plot twist in a non-linear narrative. You may not think it thrilling, but for us proposal crafting conjurers, setting up an A/B test within Qwilr is rife with adventure.

### Step 1: Creating Two Proposal Variants

Inspirations from the Fireship channel pervaded my thoughts—running code block snippets in my mind, lines like:

```markdown
A_version:
    - Call to Action: "Get Started"
    - Banner Color: Blue

B_version:
    - Call to Action: "Begin Your Journey"
    - Banner Color: Green
```

First off, you'll create two distinct versions of your proposal page. Start by duplicating your original proposal in Qwilr. Name one "Variant A" and the other "Variant B." Here, unleash your inner artist or data-savvy detective; vary one crucial element between the two pages. Whether it be text, media, layout, or colors, make it notable yet subtle. Like trying to find Waldo at a minimalist rally.

### Step 2: Publishing Those Bad Boys

With your variants prepared, it's time to blast them into the digital ether. Publish both as separate links. Let's not risk confusion, make sure each link is easy to discern from the other. As a couple of good parenthetical reminders:

- For clarity, consider adding UTM parameters to each link, such as `?variant=A` and `?variant=B`.
- Track clicks and conversions with the discerning eye of a seasoned spreadsheet wrangler.

### Step 3: Deploying Strategy Like a Chess Grandmaster

Now comes the strategy—sharing those links. This is where you can get creative, like working out a four-dimensional chess problem. Share one link with half your leads and the other with the remainder. Or distribute them alternatingly like ticket stubs. The goal? Achieve a fair distribution of website romantics interacting with both versions.

I once sent ninety emails at midnight—creative genius or ill-advised chaos, I leave to history. But we learn through doing, don’t we?

## Data Collection: Time to Crunch Numbers

The very next dawn, I sat in trepidation, clutching my mug of optimism; data began to trickle in from Qwilr’s analytics and those trusty UTM tagged links. It felt like watching a new forest grow from tiny seeds, only much faster and with less squirrel drama.

Watch for metrics like:

- **Open Rates**: Who’s stepping into your digital lair?
- **Click-Through Rates**: Are visitors hooking into your main call to action?
- **Conversion Rates**: What percentage of your prospective suitors are taking that leap of faith?

## Analyzing Results: The Moment of Truth

Combing through the results—with a brand-new Notion template and ephemeral resolve—I discovered what really resonated (or failed spectacularly). It turns out, folks preferred to "Begin Their Journey" on a powder blue backdrop. Who knew? These insights are aromatic oolong tea for your process, if tea could increase proposal success.

### Step 4: Deciding the Victor

By now, your collected data sits expectantly. It's up to us to read the room—literally numbers on screens—and determine if Variant A or B was the more captivating rogue. Statistical significance might sound like the ultimate buzzkill, but remember, the drama is in the details. 

For a quick calculation—or use your friendly neighborhood analysis tool if math sends shivers down your spine—consider the relative performance using this elemental formula:

- **Winning Percentage** = (Conversion Rate B - Conversion Rate A) / Conversion Rate A * 100

Your decision isn’t just technical, it’s one of storytelling finesse. Which narrative sings the most engaging tune?

## Implementing Insights: Time to Shine!

With our chosen variant crowned victorious, its merits culminate into something truly greater than the sum of its parts. Your finalized proposal page reloads with the ferocity of a new dawn, and us? We forge into the new horizon with fiercer proposals, like a phoenix reborn from so many project drafts.

I remember thinking at this moment: tomorrow’s challenges can only be more thrilling with today’s achievements scaffolded beneath them.

## Wrapping It All Up

So there we have it, dear compadres. Our majestic journey through the realms of A/B testing within Qwilr has reached its closing lines, but not without leaving us with storytelling embers. May we twist with creative joy the next time we open Qwilr, inspired to tweak, test, and evolve our proposals just as stories and we ourselves continually evolve.

Sharing these thoughts feels like passing along a treasured map. Explore endlessly, as there’s always another dragon to meet—or data set to delight in—on the other side of your next button color.

Feel the freedom, cherish the triumphs, and most importantly, never cease experimenting. Bust open the can of curiosity and **keep your bananas code-side up!**
