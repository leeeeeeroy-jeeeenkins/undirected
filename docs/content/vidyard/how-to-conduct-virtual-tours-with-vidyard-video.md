# How to Conduct Virtual Tours with Vidyard Video

Let me whisk you away to an ephemeral Tuesday afternoon last fall. We were sitting—cup of over-brewed coffee in hand—staring at the screen like modern-day explorers about to venture into the virtual realm. Our boss Jenny, notorious for her half-baked yet brilliant ideas, presented us with an exciting challenge: create a virtual tour for potential clients using Vidyard Video, and make it unforgettable. That's right, unforgettable. Because heaven knows, a boring virtual tour is about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. Our mission, should we choose to accept it, was to navigate through Vidyard's labyrinthine features and emerge at the other end with something that would make our clients sit up and say, "Wow, take my money!"

With Jenny's voice echoing in our heads—part inspiration, part threat—we embarked on this quest. We fumbled, we flailed, we facepalmed—but in the end, we discovered a way to create an engaging, lively virtual tour that felt as tangible as if you could almost touch it through the screen. So here we are, ready to pass on our newfound wisdom. Let’s dive in, shall we?

## Setting the Stage with Vidyard

Picture this: we kick off our Vidyard expedition with our laptops open, wondering if we might need a YouTube tutorial for this tutorial. Vidyard is a user-friendly video platform that offers businesses the ability to create and share videos tailored to engage audiences. But while it’s easy to get lost in the technical lingo, we approached it with fresh eyes—eyes that were keen on avoiding any jargon-induced headaches.

### Step 1: Create a Vidyard Account

Jenny's voice rings clear: a journey begins with a single step. In this case, it's signing up for a Vidyard account. We hopped onto the Vidyard website, clicked ‘Sign Up,’ and filled in our details with the zest of someone filling out a new diary entry—because really, isn’t every virtual adventure a personal story just waiting to unfold? Then we verified our email and boom, we were in. Vidyard welcomed us, a blank canvas ready for our creative touch.

## Crafting the Narrative of Your Tour

Think of a virtual tour like telling a story—each room, a new chapter. Jenny emphasized the importance of having a narrative that speaks to the audience. "Capture their interest, like a catchy Netflix series," she said. 

### Step 2: Plan Your Tour

We grabbed a pen and paper—there’s something profoundly grounding about good old pen and paper—and started drafting. What story were we telling? What scenes would captivate our audience? This was where creativity was our ally. We chose focal points, one key moment from each room we wanted to highlight, ensuring there was a flow to the story that would naturally guide our viewers from one point to the next. 

## Shooting the Video—Lights, Camera, Action!

Armed with our plan, we set out on the filming escapade. We were movie directors now, curating scenes with the vigor of Spielberg—but with twice the awkwardness and none of the budget.

### Step 3: Record Your Video

Vidyard provides multiple tools to capture video. We grabbed our trusty smartphones and began recording, using Vidyard's Chrome extension for our screen-capturing endeavors. A word to the wise: steady hands, folks. Nothing detracts from high-quality storytelling like shaky-cam footage, unless you're going for that authentic 'found footage' feel—and most clients? They aren't.

## Editing—The Art of Polishing the Rough Stones

Ah, editing. The part that turns raw footage into a cohesive masterpiece. It's like sculpting marble—awkwardly hitting the ‘delete’ button is oddly satisfying.

### Step 4: Edit Your Video

We uploaded our raw clips into Vidyard’s editing suite, ready to mold our story. Vidyard's tools were a godsend - intuitive yet robust. We trimmed unnecessary parts, added some background music to amp up the mood, and included captions—not just for accessibility, but because who doesn’t love a good karaoke session with video tours? Remember, edits are your friend. 

## Sharing Your Masterpiece

With starry eyes and caffeine coursing through our veins, we were ready to present our tour to the world.

### Step 5: Share Your Video

We clicked on the share menu, found the embed link, and tapped in addresses of our eager clients. Vidyard allows seamless integration with email and social media, making it - dare I say - virtually effortless. With just one click, our little passion project, born from spilled coffee and slightly panicked guidance, was out there.

## Reflecting on Journey’s End

The infographic views came rolling in, a tangible summary of clicks and play rates telling us our story had them hooked. There was relief, yes, and a sense of achievement, but more than that, it was the realization that we had opened a door to the world—sharing our space, telling our story, and creating a connection.

In rethinking how we guide these tours, we recognized that at the intersection of technology and creativity, magic can happen. Virtual tours might just be another bullet point on a checklist, but for us? They became tales waiting to be told.

And who’d have thought that all we needed were some intriguing ideas - and maybe a persistent nudge from Jenny - to transform the everyday into the extraordinary? Now let’s hope you take up your virtual passport and map out your narrative journey with Vidyard. We’ll be the voices cheering you on from digital sideline—armed with over-brewed coffee, of course.
