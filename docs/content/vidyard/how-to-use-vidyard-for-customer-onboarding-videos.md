# How to Use Vidyard for Customer Onboarding Videos

There's this thing about first experiences; they stick to you like a stubborn piece of gum, only instead of just being annoying, they shape the way you approach new things. Let me take you back to a moment not quite so distant in the past when we accidentally discovered the magic of Vidyard for customer onboarding. Picture this: it was one of those clear mornings when the sun reflected off screens and a fresh cup of coffee meant business. Our team had just decided to streamline our clunky onboarding process. The "aha!" moment arrived unexpectedly – a revelation that set us on an uncharted adventure into the world of customer onboarding videos with Vidyard. It's a journey that's changed how we do everything. Grab a comfy seat as we unravel this tale together, step by step. 

## Discovering Vidyard

Picture Alex, our tech-savvy comrade, who strolled into the meeting room with an unfamiliar vigor. With an enthusiasm only rivaled by kids on a candy spree, he pulled up Vidyard on his laptop. “Guys, we’ve been doing this all wrong! This tool? It’s magic," he exclaimed. We huddled around and exchanged skeptical glances; we wondered what kind of sorcery he had uncovered. It wasn’t long before the allure of Vidyard sucked us into its vortex.

Simply put, Vidyard is a video platform that takes your business videos and makes them not just watchable but interactive – a captivating dance of visuals and analytics. Here’s how you too can embark on your own adventure.

## Setting Up Your Vidyard Account

First things first, we need to set up our Vidyard haven. Creating an account is as easy as pie. Visit Vidyard's website, hit the "Sign Up" button, and fill out the essentials. Name, email, and a password that isn't "password123" - as exciting as a password audit is, let’s skip that thrill.

Clicking through, we felt like we were setting on a new frontier. It was as if Vidyard opened its arms wide, ushering us into its realm of possibilities. With a grin, we confirmed our email, and bam! Our account materialized like Zeus jolting reality into existence. 

## Planning Your Onboarding Video Content

Now, imagine us, nouns without direction, penning down a roadmap for our videos. Brainstorming about the specific needs of our customers and what would make their onboarding seamless was a lightbulb moment. Our storyboarding session was a collage of sticky notes and caffeinated ideas. Remember, clarity and purpose were our compasses.

Every video had to answer one question: "What should the customer learn?" We knew lists were overrated until that day, but oh boy, did they save us. Lists of key concepts, vital steps, and potential pitfalls. We needed them like a plant needs sunlight.

## Recording Your Video

In our quirky office, the recording process became our theatrical performance. We might have even used a potted plant as a stand-in prop to make our demonstrations entertaining. Perfection wasn’t the focus; authenticity was. Vidyard’s Screen and Webcam recording tool let us capture snippets of our workplace and more – it was our own little production studio, bringing it all together with minimal fuss.

You just log into Vidyard, navigate to your dashboard, and hit the “Record” button. Choose between recording your screen, using your webcam, or combining both. It’s so simple, Ted – our gadget-phobic team member – managed it on his first try without throwing out his hands in defeat.

## Customizing Your Video

Then came the customization fortress, awaiting our siege. Vidyard opens so many doors with intuitive editing features. We trimmed the fat by snipping dead air and boring bits – our epic film debuted with energy and purpose.

Headers and captions danced across the screen. As if your video was a juicy steak and Vidyard an array of spices – you add titles, calls to action, and branding to enhance the flavor. Select the annotations you like, drag, drop, and fine-tune like a maestro orchestrating a symphony.

## Adding Interactive Features

Vidyard dared us to tilt toward interactivity – those features let your video breathe life. We didn't resist. It's like using magic dust on your flat-screen performance, elevating engagement! Interactivity transforms the video from a monologue to a dialogue.

Incorporate quizzes, pop-ups, or guide your viewers with helpful prompts. Cue our 'choose your adventure' style navigation, where viewers can skip ahead to sections of interest. It’s a sprinkling of wonder that keeps them hooked!

## Publishing and Sharing Your Video

The anticipation, friends, was palpable. As creators, there's nothing quite like that moment before the rest of the world views your work. Publishing our video was exhilarating. In Vidyard, once edited and perfected (if there's such a thing), hit the publish button. From there, grab that share link like snatching candy from a piñata at a party! There it is, ready to be unleashed to the eager masses.

You can share these videos directly via email or integrate them onto your website – a tap of sophistication added to your professional presence, an edge over your competitors.

## Analyzing Performance

Finally, remember the data-driven steps we cautiously trod on? Vidyard’s analytics arrived to reveal how the sausage got made. We discovered viewers dropped off around the two-minute mark, prompting us to streamline our explanations.

Navigate to the analytics tab, and you’ll find a treasure trove of insights: viewer retention graphs, views, and engagement metrics. We adjusted material based on feedback, revising continuously, because let’s face it—the road to excellence is never one without bumps.

## The Epilogue

Ah, our journey with Vidyard. An odyssey brimming with imaginative learning, vibrant videos, and – importantly – happy, well-guided customers. Whether you’re crafting your 1st or your 100th onboarding video, here's to hoping you find as much joy and fulfillment in your Vidyard adventure as we did. As we flickered off the day’s meeting room lights, there was a comforting thought that one adventure concluded while a trillion others awaited. Hold Vidyard’s hand and step into the delightful unknown. Every step promises a lesson, a laugh, and if you’re lucky, an emphatic “aha!” moment or three.
