# How to Set Up Automated Video Emails in Vidyard: Our Adventure into Streaming Simplicity

Do you remember the first time we tried to send a video email, fumbling through different platforms, trying to figure out how to make the magic happen? It's like we were explorers unearthing the secrets of a digital jungle. If you're anything like us, you've probably faced the same burning question: How on earth do you craft automated video emails with Vidyard? That’s exactly what brought us here, and we're excited to take you along on this journey. 

## Getting Started: Where It All Began

Picture this: one late afternoon, radiant with the whispers of possibility, we found ourselves hunched over a shared laptop at a little coffee shop downtown. Julia—our behind-the-scenes tech wizard—leaned in with a mischievous gleam in her eye and said, "What if we could send videos as emails? Automated ones, at that?" And just like that, the spark ignited. 

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Vidyard Account

Before we dive into the labyrinth, let's start at the beginning. Fire up a fresh tab and Google search "Vidyard." Head over to their website and sign in. If you don't already have an account, creating one is as easy as pie. With a few taps, much like signing up with any of our ubiquitous social media platforms, you enter your email, concoct a password, and voilà, you're in. Our collective sense of accomplishment at this stage was palpable – we'd conquered the first step!

### Step 2: Navigating the Vidyard Dashboard

We found ourselves at the Vidyard dashboard, a kaleidoscopic landscape full of opportunity, waiting to be explored. Don’t get lost in the myriad of options! It’s best to stay focused on the task at hand. Affectionately known as “The Control Center,” here’s where the magic really starts. Click on **"Create"** and then **"New Video"**—our hearts skipped a beat every time we clicked it, like opening up a realm of creative possibilities.

### Step 3: Recording or Uploading a Video

Now that we’re properly oriented, it’s time to produce our masterpiece. Julia, with a twinkle in her eye, suggested we record a quick “Hello” snippet just to test the waters. Vidyard offers us a choice—to record or to upload. Like an easygoing friend, it lets you choose. Hit the record button, or if you’ve already got a snazzy video ready, simply upload it.

``` markdown
    1. Click “Create” then “New Video.”
    2. Choose to record using Vidyard's webcam or screen recording tool.
    3. Alternatively, upload a pre-recorded video.
```

### Step 4: Customizing Your Video

We quickly realized we could personalize our video emails, a touch that makes all the difference. It's like adding a little extra flair to your morning routine—something you can be proud of. Customize the title and thumbnail; this is the face your video shows to the world. Pro tip: thumbnails that feature an unexpected or humorous element tend to catch more eyes.

### Step 5: Creating a Campaign

Ah, the thrilling part! With our video polished and shining, it’s time to loop it into an automated email. We decided our first recipient should be none other than our faithful colleague, Tom—a litmus test of curiosity. Tap into the "Campaigns" tab and select "New Campaign." Here, you can customize your email template and subject line. Frankly, we spent far too long trying to come up with a witty subject line.

``` markdown
    1. Select the “Campaigns” tab.
    2. Click “New Campaign.”
    3. Choose a template and personalize your subject line.
```

### Step 6: Choosing Your Automation Tool

We might have paused here, a moment of quiet just to catch our breath. Enter the realm of automation, akin to magic spells where your video waves its wand and sends itself to a pre-defined audience. Vidyard integrates with several automation platforms, such as HubSpot, Marketo, and Salesforce. Simply choose your favored tool under the “Integrations” tab, much like choosing which spell book to take on an adventure.

### Step 7: Mapping the Journey

Configuring automation settings can feel like stringing together an intricate path in a maze. In our setup, we needed our recipient’s heart to skip a beat at exactly the right moment. Define triggers, actions, and delays—think of them as the bread and butter of any automation process. Set conditions for when the email should soar into an inbox.

``` markdown
    1. Access the “Integrations” tab and select your automation tool.
    2. Set triggers (e.g., when a new lead appears).
    3. Define actions and time delays to maintain a rhythm.
```

### Step 8: Testing and Launching

With our grand creation virtually tangible, testing was next. We sent our test video to Tom, and we waited—every beep and ping from his phone made our hearts race. Success! The video arrived just as planned, a splendid crescendo to the symphony of effort. Before full launch, send a few such testers. Catch all the peculiar bugs and nuances before it meets your entire audience. 

## Closing Thoughts

Looking back on our adventure from the dim-lit coffee shop to a bustling video-powered hub, it was worth every hiccup and eureka moment. Within Vidyard, we found not just a tool, but a partner in creativity—a silent cheerleader nudging us onwards.

Does this process feel overwhelming? Like our community of learners and digital adventurers, take it one step at a time. Each click and configuration aren’t just actions—they're part of the new digital storytelling we’re crafting together. 

We hope this tale, woven from our firsthand escapades, helps demystify the awe of setting up automated video emails. So go forth, dear reader, dance with Vidyard, and let your imagination run free with possibilities, just as we did all those weeks ago.
