# How to Customize Vidyard Video Player for Brand Consistency

## Setting the Scene

Once upon a Tuesday morning—because really, why does everything usually happen on a Monday?—I found myself staring at a video player embedded on our website that stuck out like a mismatched sock in an impeccably coordinated outfit. It was jarring, upsetting even. Vidyard had so generously provided us with their standard video player, but it didn’t quite meld with the brand vibe we’ve been cultivating like a monastery garden. And that’s when it hit me: we needed brand consistency. We needed to customize this player so deeply that one glance would make it scream our company's philosophy without uttering a single word. The road to that dream wasn’t straightforward—it was more of a curly fry tangled in branded ketchup. But that's where the magic of personalization happens, doesn’t it?

## The Initial Tangle with Vidyard Customization

Our first task was finding where Vidyard hid its customization options—it was like uncovering a secret level in a vintage game. We encountered our first savvy guide on this journey—Team Vidyard—for they had documented the process in a technical manual that spoke—ok maybe whispered—the truth. Our first step was to dive into the dashboard, which you access through Vidyard’s main website, like any good digital wizard would do. Upon logging in, tuck the URL under your hat, because you’ll need to revisit this realm.

From the dashboard, we gracefully clicked on the **Content** section—think of it as the key to the treasure chest. There we stumbled upon the list of videos, glimmering with potential. Selecting a video, the "Edit" option reveals itself like the coolest motherlode. Click there, and you’re inching closer to that gold filament of brand perfection.

### The Quest for Themacity - Colors and Logos

In our quest, we found ourselves faced with the mighty "Player Settings." This is the crossroads where our dreams of color harmony could take flight. Tinkering was necessary—because who just nails it on the first try? We experimented with *Player Color*, that was more of our company’s trademark blue than the sky ever could be. Click on the "Change" button, and let the color wheel be your guide. Once our perfect shade was achieved—we locked it in like a best friend's secret.

Ah, logos—those small emblems of jest and joy that in one graphic represent entire ideals. In the logo section under "Player Design", we launched our brand’s logo—like a perfectly curated spaceship—to inhabit the top corner of every video we proudly present. There’s a delightful option to click and upload. Note: The logo must be clear like a mountain stream and we learned the hard way to respect the size constraints so it doesn't appear fuzzy like a sleepy cat.

### Captions, Thumbnails, and Player Gadgets, Oh My!

At this juncture, the time had come for captions and thumbnails—curious artifacts that were craftable yet needed scrutinizing attention. Thumbnails are the first impression, so we needed ours to be more compelling than a mystery novel cover. There’s an easy-peasy way to upload your custom imagery or select a captivating still through the video editor. We settled for a graphic that made each user feel like this was more than a video but an experience.

Next, we dusted off our imaginations with the *calls-to-action* feature—because let's be real, no great movie skips out on the credits. Say you want to urge your audience, kindly but firmly, towards the waters of further engagement—here is where you build those bridges. Vidyard's features were more inviting than grandma’s cookies, with options to create buttons or even entire forms. A pro tip: embed gentle humor or wit if applicable—it makes clicks happier.

### Tuning the Player with Code Magic

Here's where things got tech-savvy, so we tapped into our inner geeks and donned our digital capes. Vidyard offers custom CSS options, which essentially means you're handed the blueprints and allowed to rearrange the furniture. We opened a code editor—our trusty-liked-it's-always-been-there Visual Studio Code—and recalled our rusty CSS skills. This is gold fish territory folks. Within your Vidyard dashboard, select the 'Advanced' section under 'Player Design', where you’ll see an option to add custom CSS. The code we placed lived like this:

```css
.vidyard-player-frame {
    border-radius: 15px; /* because our brand is all about smooth edges like fresh dairy butter */
}

.vy-controls {
    background-color: rgba(0, 47, 108, 0.7); /* let’s make the controls a bit see-through */
}
```

Each tweak here was akin to musical notes creating harmony. We played along these lines until the player danced seamlessly with our brand’s identity.

## Reflections and Revelations

After weeks of trials (and only one accidental player removal—we’ll admit, we panicked), we reached a point where the video player felt like an extension of ourselves, much like a cherished pair of well-worn shoes. In an odd but triumphant sort of way, it felt like finishing a home-cooked meal and having people say, “This tastes like you made it.” There's a moment of clarity when customization breaks free from a paint-by-numbers routine and transforms into the expression of your story, your quirks, your people.

And here's where we bring things full circle, back to that Tuesday morning when this journey began. Our video player does not just play—oh no, it speaks, it connects, it resonates with everything we stand for. It has become an integral part of our digital persona and one that we proudly dress up every time it goes live.

## Closing Thoughts

Just imagine—an embedded video that not only fits in but adds to the saga of what your brand represents. That mishmash of sleek design, friendly invites, and a bit of code wizardry can genuinely transform something simple into a symbol. So go forth and customize, friends, and let each video player you craft serve as proof that ingenuity and personality always find their way to the surface. Cheers to making art in unexpected places!
