# How to Measure ROI of Video Marketing Campaigns on Vidyard

Once upon a time, not too long ago, on a warm summer afternoon sipping an outrageously priced iced coffee—which, retrospectively, was worth every penny for the cooling effect—I pored over the analytics of our video marketing campaign, hosted with Vidyard. My cat, Professor Whiskers, sat on the keyboard like he owned the place, which, let’s be honest, he did. As this fluffy interloper sprawled across my ever cornered laptop, I realized the enormity of my task—to decipher the cryptic language of ROI—and communicate it in a way that made sense to my bewildered and slightly caffeine-addled brain.

Before we dive deeper into the wondrous world of Vidyard analytics, let’s embrace the shared mission of deciphering the return on investment of our video marketing escapades together. Imagine sitting on a patio overlooking the Alps—hypothetically, it's a calming thought—and untangling the ROI conundrum step by step.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Measuring ROI of Video Marketing Campaigns on Vidyard

In the grand scheme of things, measuring ROI isn't rocket science. Or maybe it is. The trick lies in aligning our left-brained analytical abilities with the right-brained creative marvels that video marketing allows. That summer afternoon, as Professor Whiskers offered his incredulous gaze, I figured out a simple, yet effective, roadmap.

#### Step 1: Set Clear Objectives

You remember that old saying, "If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there?" Same with video marketing. Setting clear objectives feels akin to plotting a treasure map with big “X marks the spot.” So, we ask ourselves—why are we uploading this whimsical masterpiece or heartfelt testimonial to Vidyard? Is it brand awareness or lead generation, maybe even product promotion or educational content dissemination?

In our specific quest, target those objectives like a cat targeting a red laser dot, only hopefully with more success than my professor friend ever achieved.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Now, let's approach the non-glamorous yet essential part. It’s time to choose what will tell us, with absolute honesty and no sugar-coating, whether we've hit that deep-buried treasure. On Vidyard, these include:

- **View count:** The number of people who clicked play.
- **Engagement rate:** Are they falling asleep in the middle, or are they glued to the screen as if it’s a cliffhanger season finale?
- **Click-through rate (CTR):** Did that masterpiece make people want more—another click worth?
- **Conversion rate:** The holy grail of video marketing; did anyone actually do what we wanted?

Sure, there’s a fancy metric bar graph that Vidyard provides within its analytics dashboard, which is nifty and intuitive if slightly intimidating at first glance—especially with furballs strolling over it—yet it remains our staunchest ally.

#### Step 3: Calculate Video Marketing Costs

Here’s where it gets tricky—one must be willing to endure the dry side of numbers for this step. Calculating cost amounts to adding up expenses like video creation expenses (crew, equipment, time spent tweaking that lighting till the sunflower looked alive), distribution costs, and any marketing dollars spent on promoting the said video.

Now, steady yourselves, as we plunge into the math pool—briefly I promise:  
`Total Marketing Costs = Video Creation Costs + Distribution Costs + Promotion Costs`

Once these figures of pain emerge from the depths of the spreadsheet abyss, they provide perspective into whether the video provided value to match such investments.

#### Step 4: Evaluate Returns

Ah, returns—the dream! Perhaps consider return metrics like sales revenue boost following the video campaign or any increased leads for your client pitch hat; these returns in attention are what justify hours spent finding the ideal backdrop, or pulling errant feline co-stars into directorial debuts.

How does this play back into Vidyard? By using Vidyard’s viewer conversion tracking, one begins to notice direct parallelisms between videos engaged and those uplifting bottom lines.

#### Step 5: ROI Calculation

Deep breath, time to do some math—and we promise, it won't be drab:

Using the formula you learned back in Algebra 101, possibly under duress:

`ROI = (Net Profit / Total Marketing Costs) * 100`

The moment of truth—did we strike gold or unearth yet more bedrock? With Vidyard making data easy to navigate, it's a sprint to those few numerical keystones.

Picture my joyous self, basked in the virtual glitter of profit graphics, while Professor Whiskers resumed his keyboard reign without remorse—keyboard kings need no ROI reassurance, evidently.

#### Step 6: Optimize and Repeat

Once the ungloriously identifying truths from data has passed, the cycle of learning loops us back to square one. Optimization defines its very core: trying out new video formats, strategizing where engagement lacked, testing scripts that deliver and, of course—a second sugar-free latte.

Vidyard, thankfully, hands us handy A/B testing tools to verify what’s working. Upon success, rinse and repeat. Improvement derives mainly from seeing data patterns over time, and on some fortuitous evenings, shared with enchanting company that challenges and delights—like cats, alongside newfound metrics understanding.

### Wrapping Things Up

As we reach the enchanting sunset hours of our discussion, our ordeal ridden with tales from the proverbial frontlines draws to a close. It’s essential to remember that measuring and improving the ROI of video marketing campaigns on Vidyard is both art and science—a reflective dance propelled by instinctual creativity and empirical formulas.

Whether you share these learnings on a sun-clad balcony or verbose video conference, it's a journey made worthwhile by the alchemy of insight, improvisation, and the occasional company of a whimsical cat. May your marketing campaigns prosper, and may you always remember the path through Vidyard's analytical forests as enjoyable rather than daunting.

And with that, friends, may we find clarity and perhaps a touch of feline-induced chaos in our future video endeavors. Here's to many more awe-inspiring insights worked out over absurdly priced coffees!
