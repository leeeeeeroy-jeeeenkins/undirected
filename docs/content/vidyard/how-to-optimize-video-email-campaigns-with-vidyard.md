# How to Optimize Video Email Campaigns with Vidyard

Let me tell you a little story. We've all been there. Gathering around the cluttered desk, cups of coffee in hand, eyes red from staring at the screen for too long—our team pondered (yet again) the eternal question: how in the world do we make email marketing less... blah? Ted, who always had a knack for stumbling into brilliance, popped up with an idea. "Why not videos?" he exclaimed, spilling his coffee in the process, but like a wizard who spilled magic beans, he set us on a path that was just as exciting as it was daunting. That's when Vidyard entered our lives like a protagonist with perfect timing. This is where the magic happened, folks.

Let’s dive into how we can sprinkle some of that magic into your very own video email campaigns using Vidyard. Picture this like a recipe for success—a dash of creativity, a sprinkle of tech magic, and a whole lot of fun.

## Embrace the Vidyard Magic: Setting the Scene

First, let’s set the scene. Picture us huddled in that tiny office, debating about the best way to steal attention in the crowded inboxes of our unsuspecting recipients. It dawned on us, quite dramatically, that words alone weren’t cutting it anymore. We wanted something more dynamic, more engaging, more... alive. Cue Vidyard.

### **Step 1: Sign Up for Vidyard**

We began our journey by diving into Vidyard, signing up was a breeze—easier than any dating app, I assure you. We visited [Vidyard’s website](https://www.vidyard.com) and slapped that "Get Started" button like it owed us money.

1. Go to [Vidyard's homepage](https://www.vidyard.com).
2. Click on "Get Started" or "Sign Up" (depending on your mood and what's on their site that day).
3. Fill in your details - this part's on you. They asked for the usual: name, email, secret handshake details, etc.
4. Confirm your email address. We suggest using your best non-spamming account. 

### **Step 2: Craft Your Video Masterpiece**

Once we were in, we had free rein of this magical land. But just like any great culinary adventure, the ingredients matter.

1. **Plan Your Video:** We brainstormed—taking inspiration from grandma's anecdotes that always seemed to captivate at family gatherings. Our emails needed that same warmth and charm.
    - Keep it short. Think espresso shot, not a full pot.
    - Focus on a single message. Clarity is your ally.

2. **Record Your Video:** Using Vidyard’s smooth-as-butter recording tools, we created the videos. It was as simple as:
    - Clicking "New Video."
    - Selecting "Record" to capture video from your webcam or screen (or both, if you’re feeling particularly daring).
    - Hit "Stop" when done. It was like being a director and actor in our own personal indie film.

Here’s a little script snippet if you're struggling to come up with an opener:

```
"Hey [Name], you know we value our relationship with you, and I wanted to personally share..."
```

### **Step 3: Polish and Shine**

Now, I’ll be honest. Our first attempt wasn’t Spielberg-level. But here’s the beauty: Vidyard lets you edit like a pro.

1. **Trim the Fat:** We trimmed the awkward silences and Ted’s impromptu bloopers.
2. **Caption Magic:** Adding captions was more accessible than we’d guessed. This little step punched above its weight by upping engagement.
3. **Thumbnails:** Choosing the right thumbnail was key. We opted for one where I wasn’t blinking—believe me, that’s harder than it sounds.

## Adding a Personal Touch: The Vidyard Secret Sauce

Fast forward to us elated in our office, realizing that adding personal touches was the secret sauce, the cherry on top of our video sundae. 

### **Step 4: Personalize, Personalize, Personalize**

Let’s not pretend we’re robots here. Adding a personal touch was everything.

1. **Use Names:** Vidyard’s features let us insert recipient names like magic.
2. **Reference Past Interactions:** Dropping a line about past events or conversations added that personal flair. “Remember the time when…?”

### **Step 5: Call-to-Action (CTA) Like You Mean It**

A good story always has a next step, doesn’t it? Beautiful videos needed equally compelling CTAs.

1. Using Vidyard, we added clickable links directly in the video.
2. We made our CTAs visible enough but not screaming like a Vegas sign. Subtle but firm—that’s the trick. 

## Sending Your Video Email with Flamboyance

As if climbing a mountain, reaching the top was half the adventure. We finally needed our masterpiece to reach inboxes.

### **Step 6: Embed Video in Your Email**

We grappled a bit with this bit like tech ninjas, but then Vidyard swooped in, sword flashing.

1. Vidyard generates an embed code. Under your video, there’s a "Share" option.
2. Choose "Email" from their options.
3. Copy the generated thumbnail link—this acts like a play button directly within the email. 

### **Step 7: Fire Away with Confidence**

With everything prepped, it was time to send our masterpiece.

1. We suggested using an email platform you are comfy with—be it Gmail, Outlook, or a carrier pigeon (if tech failed).
2. Paste the embed code in the body of the email.
3. Double-check. (We learned this lesson the hard way when “Dear John” became “Dear Joan”).

## Conclusion: Revel in Your Success

Weeks passed like scenes from a montage movie sequence. We had notable successes, some failures, and many cups of coffee that fuelled our journey. Thanks to Vidyard, what started with Ted's caffeine-fueled vision turned into a living, breathing campaign that engaged our audience in ways we hadn’t imagined.

As the dust settled and we gathered once more in our trusted huddle, we looked back at how Vidyard became not just a tool, but our companion in creating stories that didn’t just fill screens but made connections. Connections as warm and meaningful as a conversation with an old friend. Here's to your journey, staring Vidyard in the starring role.

So let's raise our cups of coffee and remember, every email is a story waiting to be told, and with the likes of Vidyard, we're not just telling them—we're living them. Cheers to that sweet success and may your campaigns rake in as much engagement as your heart desires.
