# How to Boost Ecommerce Sales with Vidyard Product Videos

It was one of those lazy afternoons—our cups of coffee long empty, plans canceled, with nothing but the glow of laptops illuminating our faces. I stumbled upon Vidyard out of sheer boredom. My ecommerce store was clocking in average sales, nothing to write home about, and it felt like that would be my destiny until the universe decided otherwise. You know the type, a serendipitous YouTube ad—one we normally skip at the first chance—stole my attention. It was a Vidyard video showcasing nothing less than magic. Products twirled, demonstrating their magnificence in 360-degree revolutions I never quite considered feasible for my humble setup. Could this be the spark to ignite my stagnant sales scene?

## The Dawn of Discovery

Now, picture us crossing into the realm of enchanted videos, where every product spins and sparkles like it has a soul of its own. "That could be us!" I announced, my voice tinged with childlike awe and perhaps a bit too much caffeine. My business partner, skeptical but intrigued, raised an eyebrow—a silent challenge accepted. We decided to dive in feet first, testing the waters with Vidyard, hoping not to sink into the abyss of forgotten internet schemes.

### Step 1: Getting Started with Vidyard

There's something almost nostalgic about starting anew, reminiscent of opening a shiny new gadget. We signed up for Vidyard—a simple process, surprisingly—and were met with a dashboard that looked more welcoming than a familiar friend's home. Creating an account was straightforward, no hidden loops or unexpected hurdles. Just an email, a good password (let’s keep those pesky hackers at bay), and a momentary pause to consider the implications of this new venture.

```markdown
- Go to [Vidyard](https://www.vidyard.com)
- Click on "Sign Up"
- Enter your email and create a strong password
- Confirm registration through your email link
```

And just like that, we’d created a little corner in the Vidyard world where our ecommerce dreams could potentially flourish.

### Step 2: Upload and Edit Your Videos

Our first attempt at creating a product video was akin to a toddler's initial steps. Wobbly and uncertain, but filled with potential. We filmed a simple intro—product set against a plain backdrop—and off the camera it went. Uploading to Vidyard was effortless, a swift drag-and-drop—like magic. But it wasn't enough to just upload; it was time to don our editor hats and get creative with the platform's editing tools, much like a culinary experiment with unexpected spices.

```markdown
- Click "Upload Video" on the dashboard
- Drag and drop your video file
- Use built-in tools to trim, add text overlays or annotations
```

Text overlays and annotations became our secret sauce, transforming a bland presentation into an engaging spectacle. "Buy me!" it whispered through captions and callouts—a digital siren song calling out to viewers.

### Step 3: Customization and Branding

Deep down, we knew the importance of standing out in the crowded ecommerce landscape. Vidyard offers customization options that could rival a fashionista's wardrobe. We needed our videos to scream our brand's essence. We selected from a palette of colors and fonts that mirrored our website’s hues, ensuring harmony in every pixel and frame.

```markdown
- Navigate to the "Customize" tab
- Choose your color scheme and font
- Add custom intro/outro for brand recognition
```

Our names may not have been up in lights just yet, but our branding was unmistakably freeing—a chance to play dress-up in the world of video marketing.

### Step 4: Adding Interactivity

This was where the narrative found its zest. We discovered that with Vidyard, a video could be more than a passive spectacle—it became a playground. We inserted call-to-action buttons, urging viewers towards our finely poised checkout pages like a guiding whisper. It turned into a game of sorts, a challenge to weave these interactives as seamlessly as possible.

```markdown
- Add Call-to-Action (CTA) by clicking "Add Interaction"
- Customize the CTA to direct viewers to your product page
- Preview and make adjustments as needed
```

Even our customer turned participant in this new dance enjoyed being nudged. Nobody likes a pushy sales pitch, but a subtle nudge? That's almost like encouragement.

### Step 5: Publishing and Sharing

And now, the pièce de résistance: sharing our masterpiece. Vidyard's integration options made it smoother than we anticipated, a harmonious fusion with our ecommerce site—WordPress, Shopify, you name it. It felt like this was Vidyard's secret handshake, welcoming all platforms into its exclusive club.

```markdown
- Click "Share"
- Select platform integration options (WordPress, Shopify, etc.)
- Embed on your ecommerce site with provided code
```

In mere moments, our videos were out in the wild, ready to charm every visitor. We watched, hearts pounding with a mix of hope and anticipation, as analytics poured in.

### The Sweet Symphony of Success

The real test was to see whether our shiny new product videos would impact our fledgling store. Would the numbers reflect the work we had put into our digital presentations? Slowly but surely, they did. Sales began to climb, each purchase more satisfying than a full plate of nachos at midnight. Customer feedback even hinted they found our store "delightfully engaging." A little hyperbole, perhaps, but we cherished it as a balm for our initial struggle.

### Conclusion

Looking back, it was evident that our foray into the world of Vidyard wasn't merely about dressing up product pages. It was about learning, taking risks, and—dare we admit—having fun while doing it. Between coffee runs and laughter-laden editing sessions, our ecommerce realm experienced an alchemical transformation into something vibrant and alive, a direct result of whimsical yet strategic video additions.

Vidyard wasn't just a tool; it became a companion in our quest, forever changing how we approached our shelves of digital wares. As we raise our mugs on another lazy afternoon, we toast to the possibilities born from video storytelling—a curious spark that dared us to dream a little bigger. Maybe you’ll join us, on your own journey, to transform your corner of the internet.
