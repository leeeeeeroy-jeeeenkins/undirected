# How to Use Vidyard Video Hubs for Better Content Organization

There's something oddly satisfying about those ancient family photo albums. The feel of glossy pages, the smell of worn paper, and the sound of plastic crinkling as we flip through. Each photo immortalizes a moment, perfectly cataloged, narrating the life of our shared family drama. Just recently, while organizing a massive digital video library, I found myself pondering the old days of tangible albums. This nostalgia set the stage for my dive into Vidyard Video Hubs, which today serve a similar purpose but for our modern world—like those photo albums but for videos, essentially, in the cloud.

Vidyard Video Hubs offer us a landscape quite like those albums. They act as organized repositories where our videos find their rightful space, breathe, exist, and speak. Imagine opening your computer and seeing that digital library, not like random post-its scattered on a desk, but akin to a dignified, leather-bound tome of your virtual story.

### Organizing with Elegance: The Beginning

Now, let's talk about how we make this digital elegance happen. Sitting at my desk, sipping this absurdly complicated coffee—honestly, it’s more chemistry experiment than caffeination—I thought about where to kickstart this journey. The best place to start? Creating our first Video Hub.

1. **Accessing Vidyard:** Log in to your Vidyard account. If you’ve never done this before, it’s as if setting foot in a digital coffee shop—more on that obsession later. Navigate to your dashboard.

2. **Create a New Hub:** Here, look for the ‘Hubs’ option in the navigation bar. Click it, like unlocking a new realm. You'll see a dazzling "Create New Hub" button—click it, and the adventure begins.

3. **Naming Your Hub:** As you ponder overnames like a parent-to-be, remember this hub is your memory palace, your video kingdom. Give it a name that would make a tattoo artist sweat over its importance.

4. **Customization Options:** Now we're in the thick of it, designing the look. It’s like when we were choosing the wallpaper for our first apartment—nobody wanted that horrendous yellow, but we made it work. Vidyard lets us pick themes, set custom logos, and even dabble in CSS for the brave-hearted.

5. **Add Videos:** Oh, this is where the magic happens. Time to pull in the vids. It’s as easy as a drag-and-drop free-for-all or as meticulous as a librarian shelving books. Select the videos you want in this hub, choose those that deserve to shine together, and upload them.

### The Art of Curation

Creating that first Video Hub felt like spanning our arms wide open to the digital universe. Remember that eclectic aunt who collects rare stamps and odd trinkets? We called her the family curator, but that's precisely what we are now: curators of our digital narrative.

1. **Organize Your Videos:** Like reorganizing those stamps Aunt Edna loves, start by organizing your videos into logical categories. If you have playlists, much like the perfect mixtape we made for our road trips, split them by themes or genres—business, leisure, existential crises, you know, the usual.

2. **Use Tags and Descriptions:** Become the poet for your videos. Use tags liberally; think of it as hashtags brought home for Sunday roast—they connect everything beautifully. Write descriptions that make Google weep in joy.

3. **Revise and Edit:** Like a university essay that requires your soul—and several late-night editing sessions—take time to review what you've added to ensure it's the best representation of your creative genius.

4. **Privacy Settings:** Aunt Edna wouldn't want just anyone glimpsing at her prized collection. Likewise, adjust the privacy settings so that your treasured videos have the audience you choose, whether the entire world or a select few.

### Sharing the Treasure

A Video Hub is meant to be shared. Like those ancient photo albums, we flip through with precious friends while lampooning our 80s hairstyles. Let’s consider how we share our precious creations.

1. **Launching the Hub:** Final touches—breathe. Press publish. It’s akin to opening night at a play, but thankfully, without any painfully tight costumes to squeeze into.

2. **Sharing Your Hub:** Share the link with the world or a close-knit circle—it's your choice. It can go out through emails, embedded on websites, or plastered across social media.

3. **Tracking Engagement:** Like watching the audience's rapt expressions during our stand-up gigs—that one about the lawnmower, remember?—use Vidyard analytics to track how viewers engage with your content.

4. **Gather Feedback:** Hosting family dinners is stressful, but valuable feedback is priceless. Gather insights on viewer experiences to elevate your hub even further.

### Refining the Journey

Creating and curating doesn't end once the hub goes live—it’s an evolving work of art. Like an ongoing novel, sometimes a plot twist here or there makes it even better.

1. **Periodic Updates:** In a way, it’s akin to checking on our plants, ensuring they're watered and receiving enough natural light. Regularly update your Vidyard Video Hub with fresh content.

2. **Analyze Performance:** Use Vidyard’s analytics, our digital crystal ball, to see how each video performs. Are they shining like stars or wilting onstage? Rethink, replan, and rejoice in their rebirth.

3. **Adjust Aesthetics:** Just like a room benefits from a splash of new paint every few years to bring life again to weary walls, revise your hub's appearance based on feedback or when the mood strikes.

4. **Gather Team Input:** Two heads are usually better than one, or so they say. If you're working within a team, holding regular brainstorming sessions, can add a new creative spark—like when Chris suggested adding Edna’s wildcard recipe vlogs to spice things up!

### Reflections on Our Journey

Our journey doesn’t end with the creation of a Vidyard Video Hub. It’s a perpetual evolving story, an embracing of the digital revolution where our memories and moments float in zeros and ones, waiting to be shared and celebrated.

Isn’t it fascinating how something as mundane as organizing videos can open a floodgate of creativity? Like sifting through sand, we find the gems to brandish proudly. Video Hubs stand as testimony to our digital evolution, transforming scattered memories into an epic, and dare I say, cinematic endeavor.

Through creating video hubs, we bond over shared stories, reminisce over goofy outtakes, and continue building our collective narrative. Maybe, just maybe, digital photo albums aren’t so far from those we cherished. After all, they're just waiting for us to breathe life into them.
