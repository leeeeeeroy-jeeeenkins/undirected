# How to Use Vidyard for Internal Communication

I remember the first time Maria suggested we try Vidyard for our internal communication at work. We were gathered around the makeshift conference table in her makeshift—read: cramped—office, after yet another long, yet riveting, presentation. Maria, in her typical irreverent flair, said, "We need to stop boring everyone to death with these slide decks and try something fresh, like Vidyard." At that moment, I had my doubts. Technology, as much as it aids us, often feels like a finicky guest at a dinner party, messing with the flow of good conversation. But little did I know, that small suggestion would pivot our communication style into a vibrant, engaging new direction.

Just like the unexpected embrace of a good friend, Vidyard surprised us with its charm and simplicity. Let me guide you through this transformative journey of using Vidyard to spark lively internal connections, sprinkled with our glorious missteps and triumphs.

## First Steps: Setting the Stage

Before strapping in for the flight, we had to ensure we knew how Vidyard played its game. We opened our laptops, like old-school explorers whipping out their trusted compasses, ready to chart new territory.

### Create An Account

Navigate to Vidyard's [website](https://www.vidyard.com/). There’s this friendly green button screaming "Sign Up Free," which, of course, was irresistible. It takes seconds to climb aboard; sign-up requests your email, a password, a few personal details—and, voilà, a brand-new Vidyard account is born, free as a bird.

### Install the Vidyard Browser Extension

Vidyard, bless its digital heart, has a browser extension for Chrome and Edge. Maria patiently guided us—ok, more like dragged us—through the process:

- Head to the Chrome Web Store (or Edge Add-ons page).
- Search for "Vidyard."
- With a single click on "Add to Chrome," we felt that peculiar satisfaction of extending a virtual hand into the future.

We now had a nifty tool sitting at the top of our browsers, ready to capture our upcoming brilliance.

## Lights, Camera, Action: Creating Videos

Now, creating videos as a form of communication felt like jumping into the deep end without floaties. Our first trial was less than cinematic. Imagine a collection of awkward smiles and robotic waves, akin to a horror film shot on a 1990s camcorder. But, hey, that’s what the delete button is for!

### Recording a Video

Click on the Vidyard extension. You're met with a tempting red dot labeled "Recording." A single click starts the magic. Vidyard offers options: Record only the tab, the entire screen, or dive heart-first into webcam mode. Often, we'd enthusiastically wave to each other on webcam mode—accidentally replicating a Brady Bunch intro.

We learned to reign in our inner Spielbergs, and here’s how:  

1. **Plan Your Content**: Kicking-off without a script often led to rambling, so we learned to outline our key points, keeping videos concise.
2. **Engage with Your Audience**: Speak as if you’re chatting with a friend. This was initially hard—turns out, I could drone even without an audience.
3. **Be Mindful of Backgrounds**: Bob's legendary video, with a rogue cat intermission, was a learning moment. Clear the clutter—or set the cat up with its own channel!

### Editing the Video

Once we mastered the art of recording—or gracefully stumbled through—editing waited ominously down the path. Vidyard, thankfully designed for the creatively impaired, provides basic trimming features to tidy up excess footage.

Click “Edit,” and chop away like a fervent gardener pruning unruly bushes. Trim any awkward silences or unplanned cat appearances—and save the masterpiece.

## The Final Act: Sharing Masterpieces

Creating these videos was just the couch wrestling pre-game; sharing them was the main event. Unfortunately, sharing wasn’t as straightforward as a "send" button, but not too far-fetched.

### Sharing with the Team

Oh, the joy of Vidyard links, as Maria enthusiastically announced during a team meeting:  

- Hover over your recorded video and choose "Share."
- Copy the link—like a stealthy ninja stealing cookies.
- Share it via email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or any platform that connects your squad. Our personal favorite: embedding them in our weekly newsletters, complete with snazzy thumbnails.

### Adding Privacy Settings

Privacy’s the name of the game, so we didn’t leave this part out. Vidyard offers options to secure videos with passwords or limit their visibility—crucial for internal-only content.

## A Twist of Creativity: Using Vidyard for Engagement

We soon realized Vidyard was more than just a broadcasting tool; it could create interactive experiences during huddle meetings, onboarding sessions, or even morale-boosting updates.

### Interactive Features

The interactive tools felt like adding sprinkles on a sundae:

- **Call-to-Actions (CTAs)**: Add buttons at video’s end for direct feedback—great for quick polls.
- **Annotations**: Highlighted key points—like a glass of red wine emphasizing a conversation about travel or philosophy.
  
Every time we embedded one of these extras, there was a brief moment where we could bask in the illusion of being tech-savvy geniuses.

## Wrapping It Up

Concluding this whimsical adventure into the tech galaxy—where unexpectedly delightful things await our sometimes skeptical minds—is like that heartfelt goodbye at the end of a memorable party. Vidyard evolved from a tentative foray into an integral, dynamic part of our internal communication. This tool made updates less tedious and injected some much-needed personality into our virtual interactions. When Maria suggested we experiment with Vidyard, little did we know our team’s communication would be revolutionized with some humor, a splash of creativity, and occasional feline interruptions.

Thus, here's to more adventures, more creative missteps, and celebrating each video as if it's the digital equivalent of a roaring campfire story.

Together, let’s keep discovering new ways to connect, because, after all, our internal team vibe might just be the most interesting show in town.
