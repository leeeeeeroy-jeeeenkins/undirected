# How to Leverage Vidyard for Social Media Video Marketing

Right, so there we were, sitting cross-legged in the sun-drenched attic that jazzily doubled as our creative empire headquarters, and the birds outside chattering away like investors in a frenzied conference call. It was just another Tuesday. My partner in digital crime, Sam, and I had decided we'd finally crack the social video marketing code. Vidyard had been whispering promises of sleek video magic in our ears, and it was time to listen — or so we hoped.

Fast forward to the part where you and I are about to embark on this journey together. Spoiler: Vidyard turned out to be more than just another platform; it was a kaleidoscope of opportunities, sporting both dazzle and depth for those willing to dive in. So, let’s roll up our sleeves and dive into this kaleidoscope!

## Discovering Vidyard's Interface

First things first, imagine a dashboard as welcoming as a newly baked pie. As Sam and I logged into Vidyard for the first time, we were greeted by an interface that was more friend than foe. The left-hand sidebar, an elegant wardrobe of options, beckoned us without a hint of intimidation.

We clicked on the "Videos" section as if pressing an old elevator button — both an act of faith and adventure. Here, we were able to see existing video files, a simple yet powerful list that laid out our video vault.

### Our Step-by-Step Process: Getting Acquainted

1. **Login to Vidyard**: Open Vidyard in your favorite browser. Log in, or sign up if you haven't already — a quick dance of typing and password recitation.
   
2. **Explore the Dashboard**: Navigate through the left sidebar. This is your metaphorical map; don't be shy to explore "Videos", "Analytics", and "Player Design".

   - **Pro-tip**: Click everything. Yes, really. We mean it.

3. **Understanding Your Library**: The "Videos" section is home base. Here you'll find all your uploaded content — the treasure chest of your marketing potential.

The interface was immediately intuitive — like shaking hands with an old friend who's been expecting you.

## Uploading and Organizing Videos

Now, let's talk about the zen garden of uploading. You see, it's not just about flinging videos into the platform like frisbees into the wind. Nope, Vidyard allows us to curate and primp our video content with style.

### Our Step-by-Step Process: Uploading Videos

1. **Hit the "Upload" Button**: You'll find it in the "Videos" section, like a bright lighthouse guiding you safely to shore.

2. **Select Your Files**: Drag and drop, or tap to choose the masterpiece(s) from your gadget. Vidyard slurps up these files with the enthusiasm of a kid downing an ice cream cone on a summer's day.

3. **Add Titles and Tags**: Think SEO meets personal flair. Titling and tagging are intimate — as if naming your goldfish.

4. **Organize with Folders**: Use folders to keep your video treasure trove neat and manageable. Trust me, future you will thank present you.

Sam and I realized this step saved us from diving blindly into a digital jumble, allowing us instead to lay out our content like aromatic cheeses on a party platter.

## Customizing Video Players

After uploading comes the whimsically wonderful act of customization. Vidyard's player design feature turned out to be like tailoring suits for each of our videos, each cut and stitch speaking to our audience.

### Our Step-by-Step Process: Customizing Players

1. **Click "Player Design"**: On your left sidebar, find and fondly click.

2. **Choose Your Theme**: Vidyard offers themes that are the sartorial choices for your videos' wardrobes.

3. **Add Calls to Action (CTAs)**: Encourage interaction by adding CTAs, one part street sign, one part poetry.

4. **Personalize Player Colors and Layouts**: It's your canvas; splatter joy in color and form.

Sam's excitement was palpable; he got lost in the colors like Monet in a garden. Meanwhile, I found clashing combinations strangely satisfying, proving that video marketing is a true art form.

## Analyzing Engagement

Naturally, our quest wasn't complete without peeking at performance like the curious cats we are. Vidyard’s analytics turned numbers into insight, transforming guesswork into strategy.

### Our Step-by-Step Process: Analyzing Engagement

1. **Navigate to "Analytics"**: It’s there in the left sidebar — your crystal ball staring back at you.

2. **Review Key Metrics**: Views, play rates, and engagement data await you like old friends ready to spill their secrets.

3. **Diagnose and Adjust**: Use this data to pinpoint success stories and places needing a little narrative spice.

I remember the moment Sam cried out about our first viral success — like Archimedes hoisting his metaphorical Eureka! We danced around the room, overwhelmed with the sense of potential unfolding before us.

## Sharing on Social Media

Finally, with everything in place - it was like preparing the most sumptuous dish for a grand feast - came the sharing. Vidyard made it seamless to distribute our video creations to the world like dandelion seeds in a spring breeze.

### Our Step-by-Step Process: Sharing Videos

1. **Select Your Video**: Return to your "Videos" collection; choose the ones ready to meet the world.

2. **Utilize Social Sharing Tools**: Vidyard gives you tools — like spades and shovels — to plant your content in the fertile fields of social platforms.

3. **Integrate with Platforms**: Post directly or embed your videos within social media giants like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn — planting them in fertile ground.

4. **Monitor and Respond**: Engaging with viewers is as essential as the first sip of coffee in the morning. Monitor comments, respond, and foster community.

With videos soaring into the stratosphere, Sam and I could finally sit back and watch the magic unfold — except we didn’t, as there was always something new to learn or a video to improve.

## In the End: Embracing the Joy of Video Marketing

It’s now you, me, and the shared laughter of digital adventure - not at all small, but grand and expansive. Vidyard, a companion in video marketing, will surprise you with its elegance and depth — much like Sam did, when he decided to adopt two cats to celebrate our newfound skills (and chaos).

So, embrace the Vidyard journey. Leverage its tools, explore its depth, and never hesitate to dive deep. And remember, between every upload and share, lies a story waiting to unfold — just as every Tuesday began for us, with sun dancing through the attic windows and birds weaving tales that seemed to know the digital stories we were about to create.
