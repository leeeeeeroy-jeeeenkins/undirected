# How to Explain Complex Concepts Simply with Vidyard Videos

It was the summer of 2019. I remember it vividly because it was right after an intense heatwave that our team embarked on a project that felt as elusive as catching water in a sieve: explaining quantum computing to a group of marketers. I was convinced that by some cosmic mistake, I’d be mistaken for Einstein. With furrowed brows and a feeling of impending doom, we knew we had to think differently.

Our epiphany came unexpectedly. We were brainstorming, probably on our third pot of coffee, when our junior associate, Michael, blurted out, “Why not use video?” It was one of those moments where time sort of stops, and you see things in a fresh, vivid way. That's when we discovered Vidyard. The following journey, with its comedic bouts of trial and error, transformed the way we communicated complex ideas - paving the way for us to create simple, engaging videos that anyone could understand.

Let's dive into how you, too, can leverage Vidyard videos to demystify those mind-boggling concepts. 

## Finding Your Flow: Mapping Out the Complex

One of the first things we did was sit around and talk about who needed to understand quantum physics—our audience of marketers, bless their souls, who didn't need PhDs in physics to grasp the basics. We realized that the crux of understanding starts with empathy and curiosity. You gotta step into the shoes of your audience. So, with post-it notes in hand and pizza boxes piled high, we sat down and drafted what we'd need to say if we were telling it over a campfire. That night, the walls of the office were a veritable mosaic of stickies—each one representing a complex idea we had simplified to its core essence.

So here’s your first task: live the story, breathe it, and then map it out. Break it down into understandable chunks while staying loyal to the essence of the concept. 

## Lights, Camera, Action: Using Vidyard Like a Pro

Once our ideas were mapped out, it was time to transform them into video. At this point, Vidyard felt as familiar as an old friend. The interface was intuitively designed, eliminating frictions that my caffeine-deprived mind couldn't handle. Our jovial yet slightly frazzled media intern, Amy, took the reins, and here’s what followed:

1. **Record Your Screen**: We started with screen recordings. Vidyard's built-in tools let you capture your screen while also allowing your face to pop in a small bubble—a touch of humanity amidst a digital storm. Amy laughed about how she could relate to the talking heads on TV now.

    ```markdown
    To record, simply click the 'Record' button on Vidyard, choose 'Screen,' and start presenting.
    ```

2. **Craft Your Narrative**: As we recorded, we spoke as if explaining to a ten-year-old, often resorting to charming metaphors that likened quantum computing to sorting socks (which surprisingly worked!). You didn’t have to sound like a professor to convey meaning. 

3. **Edit Like a Film Critic**: Once recorded, we wielded the edit tool like artistic warriors; trimming unnecessary bits and injecting text overlays or graphics where explanations benefited from visual reinforcement. Keep it simple, but informative.

4. **Use Calls-To-Action (CTAs)**: After some experimental attempts, we landed on strategic places for CTAs—inviting viewers to explore further details or interact with extra resources. Like pepper, a little bit goes a long way.

    ```markdown
    Insert CTAs through Vidyard by selecting 'Content', then 'Call to Action', and customize as needed.
    ```

## The Art of Simplicity: Engaging, Not Overpowering

That first video took days but was worth every second. We watched, wide-eyed, as our audience engaged with the content in ways we hadn’t expected. My fondness for this tool only burgeoned as I saw its potential to teach complexity in digestible bites—without losing meaning. There’s a certain elegance in simplicity, yet achieving balance demands resolve.

Vidyard's analytical dashboard helped us refine future videos. It’s like peering into the minds of your audience, understanding what they'd gulped down eagerly and where glances were averted. This feedback loop was instrumental!

## Keeping It Human: Bring A Little You

Sometimes, in our quest to distill and simplify, we risk becoming robotic. Which is a terrible irony because our aim is to make concepts relatable. We sprinkled our scripts with subtle humor, poked a little fun at the complexity, and welcomed mistakes—like the time I pronounced "Qubit" as "Q-bite" which led to an unexpected but enlightening tangent that reassured the audience they too could make sense of the material without flawless perfection.

And you know what? That’s okay. People don’t relate to androids churning out information devoid of personality. It's our quirks and candid moments that make the journey enjoyable and lend authenticity to our messages.

## Conclusion: A New Chapter in Communication

Flash forward to today. What started as an experimental nudge from Michael has become an integral part of how we disseminate intricate concepts across the team and beyond. We’re still amazed at how something as accessible as Vidyard has transformed our approach, making the incomprehensible simply intuitive.

When you break it down, explaining things simply isn’t just about dumbing it down—it’s about smart communication. It’s about distilling complexity into understandable and relatable narratives that your audience—whether seasoned experts or curious novices—can digest with ease.

So next time you face a mountainous concept that requires translation into plain speak, remember: the delightful alchemy of story craft, video, and engaging visuals on Vidyard is yours to wield. Embrace it with verve and know this: It’s not always about talking down, but rather inviting up. And I would bet that’s precisely how Einstein would have preferred it too.
