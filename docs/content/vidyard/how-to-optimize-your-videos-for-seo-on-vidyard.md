# How to Optimize Your Videos for SEO on Vidyard

We've all been there, standing on the precipice of creativity, brimming with ideas, yet feeling like a lost wanderer when it comes to sharing them. It was just a typical Thursday afternoon when our big break came. We had uploaded a snazzy little tutorial video on Vidyard—one of the many ideas that brewed over endless cups of coffee and conversations overshadowed by an ancient sense of dread: the dreaded SEO optimization. That's when it hit us like the soft thud of a library book off a disorganized shelf: our masterpiece was languishing, unviewed and unappreciated. Why? Because we hadn't optimized our video for SEO. Thus began our journey, laden with trials and triumphs, which we're now sharing with you like a well-worn secret handshake.

## Step 1: Research Keywords That Matter

Remember our first Vidyard venture? We tossed our video into the ether, blissfully keyword-less, akin to throwing a message in a bottle into the vast ocean. But here's what we learned. SEO, much like a good pizza, starts with the base—keywords. Think of these as the strings to a web of viewers. Begin by brainstorming what your potential viewers might search for. "How to juggle flaming torches" or "Beginner ukulele jams," perhaps?

There are delightful tools, such as Google Keyword Planner or even Vidyard’s own insights, which really help us hone in on these search terms like a squirrel hunting for the most sumptuous acorn.

### Our Own Veins-Bulging Experience

Once, during a particularly caffeine-fueled midnight session - a brainstorming blitz if you will - we stumbled across an insight we hadn't seen before. It was buried under a pile of Excel sheets like a hidden jewel of knowledge. We realized the importance of specificity. "DIY Rocket Toaster Launches" and "Kittens in Tiny Hats" were the specifics viewers were hungry for.

## Step 2: Craft a Magnetic Title

A title is like that first friendly handshake—or, realistically, it's like a trusty clickbait that whispers enticing promises. We quickly discovered that a well-crafted, keyword-rich title not only garners clicks but also lovingly caresses search engine algorithms like a purring feline.

### That One Time We Nailed the Title

Case in point was our once-disaster titled "Video Blog 4". With some sprinkled inspiration - reminiscent of an impromptu ukulele jam - we transformed it to "How to Create Alluring Video Content: A No-Nonsense Guide". Our engagement numbers danced like they were on roller skates, off the charts!

## Step 3: Description: The Overlooked Jewel

Ah yes, the video description. A veritable treasure trove, often overlooked like a side street thrift shop. With time, we found it was more than a formality but a way to weave in story-like keywords—drenching our content in rich context and inviting viewers on a narrative journey.

### Evaluating "The White Whale Description"

In an inspired frenzy akin to catching the perfect wave just before sunset, we dove deep into writing descriptions. Sketching them as mini-stories, loaded with sprinkle keywords and call-to-actions, we noticed the magic unfolding. Our engagement rate multiplied faster than rabbits in spring.

## Step 4: Leverage Tags Like a Maestro

Ah, the subtle art of tagging—think of these as the witty asides in your favorite TV show. Tags dictate the video’s context to Vidyard’s algorithm, enhancing searchability like adding spice to a well-cooked meal. These can include both short and long-tail keywords, giving our content the wings it needed to fly.

### Once Upon a Tagging Mishap

In a moment of overly zealous energy, fueled by double-shot espressos that left us jittery and ferociously typing, we overloaded our tags. All chaos broke loose, and we learned our lesson. Balance, much like in tai chi, is everything.

## Step 5: Playlists: The Story Arcs

Picture this as stringing beads on a necklace. The right playlist pulls viewers from one video jewel to the next in seamless succession. It was during a rainy winter afternoon, buried under blankets, that we discovered playlist SEO's secret sauce. It mirrors the arrangement of a story arc—building suspense, climax, and the soft landing of a resolution.

### The Playlist Symphony Experience

Like the opening chords of an epic finale, curating specific categories like “Epic DIYs” or "Thrilling Thimble Theatrics" engaged viewers longer, enhancing watch time and those golden algorithms nodded approvingly.

## Step 6: Transcripts: The Unsung Hero

At first glance, a transcript appears as mundane as an office memo. But let us tell you—the epiphany struck us as hard as forgetting your coffee on the roof of your car, that transcripts skyrocket accessibility and SEO, offering search engines delightful feasts of text content to chew on.

### The "Transcription Triumph"

There was this instance, lost in thought and laminations over how to give more bounce to our video SEO, where transcripts so elegantly narrated our content that the audience – and the algorithms – lapped it up like a cat with cream.

## Step 7: Encourage Viewer Interaction

Engagement is more than just a buzzword; it's the life-affirming pulse of each successful video. Comments, likes, and shares breathe life into your content, sometimes turning your Vidyard channel into a bustling digital carnival.

### The Engaging Epiphany

While casually tossing around Nerf balls one sunny afternoon - brainstorming strategies one can only dream about - we landed on the engaging tactic of incorporating direct questions and call-to-action phrases. “Tell us your thoughts on XYZ” was surprisingly effective. Viewer interaction became a potent force, alive with discussions, debates, and homegrown ideas sprouting like wildflowers in spring.

## Conclusion: Crafting SEO as an Artform

So here's the take-away from our Ecclesiastical Journey: optimizing videos on Vidyard isn't simply a mechanical task; it’s an art form. It's part craft, part intuition, much like when Bob Ross turned a simple stroke into a ‘happy little tree.’ Armed with these tools, let’s venture forth to share and illuminate, our videos streaming like fireflies in the digital starlit night.

### The Ultimate Sigh of Contentment

In the calm after the storm of activity, once videos burgeoned with engagement, views, and even 'aha!' comments, we leaned back—sipping the nectar of accomplishment, resonating with a satisfaction tinged with just the right dash of humor. Let's toast to the antics and the victories, as evermore videos find their rightful home in the cosmos.
