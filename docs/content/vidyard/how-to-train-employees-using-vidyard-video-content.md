# How to Train Employees Using Vidyard Video Content

I remember this one time we had a team meeting—well, more like a free-for-all brainstorming session—in a cramped little office where the AC had betrayed us. The air was hot and stifling, much like our attempts to ignite excitement about a new training platform. We were all huddled around a laptop that was trying harder than any of us to keep cool, introducing Vidyard as our new magical engagement tool for employee training. At least that was the plan. But plans, like promises to stop binging TV shows on work nights, are often easier said than done. 

And still, through the haze of warm air and frizzed-out thoughts, something clicked—or maybe that was just the laptop fan dying—not sure. But that day was pivotal. We realized that training didn't have to be the same old chalk-and-talk. It could be visual and dynamic and everything that our outdated manual wasn’t. We'd stumbled upon an idea that would change the way our team learned and shared knowledge, through Vidyard's shimmering world of video content.

### Discovering the Joy of Visual Learning

Have you ever been to one of those parties where everyone's trying to sound smart, and there’s that one guy—let’s call him Gary—who casually drops a reference to some painter from the 1600s no one's heard of? Yeah, that’s how the 'video might take over training' idea felt at first. Except Gary here was right. Video content was a revelation. 

Vidyard, in particular, isn't just your run-of-the-mill video platform. It allows you to create content that's as interactive as a pesky pop-up quiz (which isn't always bad) and as engaging as puppy videos during a lunch break. The beauty lies in its simplicity and versatility, allowing us to craft videos that could engage, educate, and even entertain. And let's face it, if you can keep Bob from IT awake and involved during a 30-minute training session, you're onto something.

### Educating with a Personal Touch

The most delightful discovery—besides finding out you can use humorous sound effects—was how personal video content could be. Unlike generic training modules that feel rather like droning monotones from a lackluster presenter, Vidyard videos let us sound like, well, us. Warm, insightful, a bit like a story your grandma might tell but with less mention of her cat's antics. 

To get started with Vidyard, we decided to doodle a script. Warning: This means you'll need to play director, scriptwriter, and sometimes, the unlucky soul in charge of coffee runs. But don't worry—it's all part of the adventure. Begin by fleshing out your script. What message do you want to communicate? What pitfalls did you—not entirely successfully—face initially? Now, get cozy with your cellphone or a decent camera because filming is next. Honestly, don’t sweat over perfection like producing a blockbuster; it's about authenticity. 

### The Magic of Interaction

One of the Vidyard aspects that caught our attention faster than a rogue ping pong ball was its interactive features. You can add calls to action within your video, linking to resources or follow-up quizzes; these aren't just buttons, they're like the secret passageways you wanted to find in your grandparent's attic as a kid. It meant our employees weren't passive observers; they were *participants*. 

Then there was the easier-than-breathing analytics Vidyard provides. We—a group not really known for fondness towards graphs or numbers—could easily track who watched what and where they dropped off. In retrospect, it’s not unlike knowing who's sneaking out of your house party early. But instead of feeling rejected, we used this data to improve and snazz up our content, adding a splash of humor here, a dollop of fun facts there.

### Sharing the Experience

Turning the learning process into a shared experience was part of what ended up making Vidyard a hit—or perhaps something akin to a puppy learning not to chase its tail too fast. We began encouraging feedback, almost like opening up a dialogue. Remember that stifling meeting room? Well, it morphed into the site of fresh-idea exchanges and laughter-filled video reviews, as employees shared quirky reaction videos or amiable critiques. 

Creating a collaborative atmosphere was reminiscent of that sticky moment you decided to start crafting Christmas cards in July with friends—communal and just the right amount of chaos. Everything from setting up informal 'video-learning lunches' to sharing our creative bloopers created a tapestry of shared learning. 

### Embracing Change

Making the shift wasn’t without its growing pains, hinting at new norms and old dogs learning new tricks. There were times our attempts ended in the dust of confusion—and oh, the blooper reels we never saved! But the transformative journey to learning through Vidyard was like that long, scenic route to the beach on a sunlit summer day, no wrong turns, just interesting detours.

We're no immense corporations; we're like every other small to mid-sized business attempting to shape change as much as change molds us. Yet using Vidyard’s content to train our employees, we uncovered a sense of unity, a tool that gifted us a method to connect deeper, with intent, and with a generous portion of fun.

Embedding humor, shared laughter, and an openness to wild ideas here and there, in the end, flipped the modal on its head. Yes, we learned plenty about video content creation, a dusting of tech skills, and navigating complex workflows with ease. But it was in those shared human moments—where learning felt not just achievable but also incredibly enjoyable—that change happened. And it’s not like we brought along any paintbrushes from the 1600s to do it. 

Now, go on, grab that camera and start your own adventure. Here’s a toast to Vidyard: may the bloopers never be as bad as Gary's historical references.
