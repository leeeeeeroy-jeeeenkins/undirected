# How Vidyard Can Improve Internal Communications

It was one of those typical days at the office when everything needed to be done yesterday. E-mails were flying faster than a swift sparrow in the spring, the phone calls were endless, and yet, nobody seemed to have a clue about what was actually happening. Then it hit us—right during the lunch break, as Lucy spilled her coffee while laughing at one of Joe’s terrible jokes. We needed a better way to communicate internally, something that wasn't as dry as toast left out in the sun. Enter Vidyard—a shiny beacon of hope in our muddled communication sea.

## Finding a Solution in Caffeine Timing

We remember it vividly. There was a season when every meeting seemed like a clandestine gathering where secrets were discussed, but not shared properly. Remember Dave from sales who never got the memo about our "Casual Friday" rule change, showing up in full business attire while the rest of us looked like weekend warriors? Or that time when Jane in HR didn't know about the updated vacation policy, resulting in an overcomplicated misunderstanding that lasted far longer than it ever should have. Yes, those times were aplenty. Then Vidyard came to our rescue.

### The Epiphany

Joe had heard about it from a podcast—something about how video communication was revolutionizing the business landscape. "Video," he said with a twinkle in his eye and, I swear, a pretentious wave of the hand. "Why have we not thought about this?" That was the spark we needed. Vidyard was about to be our game-changer.

## Embracing Video Communication

We dived in, head first, into the world of Vidyard. It was like opening a door we didn't know existed, leading to a land where things made sense and everyone was on the same page—or at least in the same chapter.

### Getting Started

Our journey with Vidyard began with experimenting during our weekly team huddles. Initially hesitant—like cats to water, truly—we set up our first account, unsure what to press and what would happen if we pressed it. But we persevered. 

1. **Create an Account**: First things first, visit [Vidyard's website](https://www.vidyard.com/) and create an account. It’s as simple as signing up for a newsletter, minus the part where they bombard you with e-mails. 

2. **Download the Browser Extension**: Get the Vidyard extension for your browser. This feature was the MVP in our playbook, making video creation as swift as a magician's trick. 

3. **Record that Masterpiece**: With Vidyard, recording videos feels like a breeze. We hit that record button with the same excitement as teenagers discovering a new social media platform. There’s the option to share your screen—judiciously ensuring no personal tabs are left open—or keep it straightforward with good old face-to-camera action.

4. **Instant Sharing Magic**: Once you’ve recorded the video—voilà!—a shareable link is automatically generated. No fussing with downloads and uploads. Just copy and paste it right into an email or a chat, and you’re set.

5. **Track the Engagement**: Vidyard doesn't stop at just video. You get metrics too—fancy graphs and numbers showing you who watched your video, for how long, and even if they bailed after realizing it was just 20 minutes of you enthusiastically demonstrating how to properly load a dishwasher. That’s a goldmine for those of us who thrive on feedback.

## The Magical Video Flip

It was like our office had flipped a switch. Instead of those drab, text-heavy emails that felt like reading the terms and conditions, we were sharing quick video updates. 

### Capturing the Day-to-Day

Taking you back to a specific Thursday—our first success was during the autumn monthly report. Instead of sending out a hefty document, Sarah made a succinct five-minute video summarizing all the highlights—charts included. It somehow made budget reports the kind of thing you’d actually want to watch, not skip through like a pre-flight safety video.

## Human Connections in a Digital Age

Vidyard brought us closer. Don’t get us wrong, we weren't suddenly a tight-knit group holding hands and singing songs together, but those little personalized video messages did wonders. Remember when Gloria sent a birthday greeting to Sam with a hasty, yet mostly in-tune rendition of "Happy Birthday"? That was only possible via the personal touch of Vidyard. 

### Maintaining That Personal Touch

1. **Keep it Casual**: Unlike overly rehearsed company videos, we embraced our authentic selves. Blooper reels became a beloved part of our Vidyard experience, fostering genuine smiles and inside jokes.

2. **Highlight People, Not Just Processes**: Every Friday, two-minute shoutouts spotlighted individual achievements or birthdays. We found the secret sauce was in focusing on people rather than paper trails.

3. **Feedback Loop**: With Vidyard, we created feedback loops that were constructive rather than intimidating. Colleagues gave feedback directly through video replies, preventing those lengthy email chains which required deciphering akin to cryptic novels.

## But All Good Things Have Their Challenges

Ah yes, not everything was a bed of roses. We did face some hurdles—and not the kind of quirky obstacles that make for funny sitcom plot devices either.

### Quality Quirks

There were days when the video quality was akin to watching an old VHS tape. But we learned—a better internet connection, and a mug of coffee could sometimes solve the world's problems.

### Adoption Angst

Teams not hopping on board the Vidyard train was a challenge too. It took some coaxing, a bit of bribery involving donuts, but the visible results swayed even the staunchest of email aficionados.

## Reaping the Benefits

While Vidyard's benefits are plenty, it wasn't just about obsidian-rich efficiency. It was about adjusting the sails to the winds of modern communication.

### Enhanced Clarity and Engagement

Without Vidyard, discussions naturally drift into email threads as windy as a mid-July thunderstorm. With it, we encapsulated messages that were quick, clear, and often entertaining enough to maintain engagement levels previously unheard of.

### Visual Learning Aid

Another benefit we discovered in our sorcerer’s bag of tricks was the power of visual aids. Training sessions, long and verbose, transformed into digestible visual snippets employees could access on demand.

## Lessons Learned

In our enthusiastic journey, a moment to reflect upon—Vidyard bridged gaps, not just in communication, but in camaraderie. It added an element of humanity in a world where computer screens often separate us.

### Consistency Over Complexity

We realized early—consistency was preferred over elaborate productions. Regular video communication beat out glossy company videos locked away like corporate treasures.

### Fostered a Culture of Sharing

It wasn’t long before even the resident introverts were sharing their colorful thoughts with ease. A sea change in culture where openness danced with technological prowess.

## Conclusion: A New Era

Our journey with Vidyard was like bringing a touch of sparkle to the mundane corporate landscape. It empowered us, transformed misconceptions about internal communications, and brought a little joy into our daily grind.

Would we have believed, sipping lukewarm cafeteria coffee that Tuesday afternoon—with no particular direction home—that a digital tool could have this kind of impact on our professional lives? Maybe not. But looking back, we feel grateful for the way Vidyard came into our orbit—changing not just how we communicate, but how we connect.

In the end, we realized that good communication isn't just about the tools—though Vidyard certainly helped—but about keeping human connection front and center, minus the lengthy emails, misunderstood memos, and sartorial missteps. Here's to more efficient, more humane communication adventures in our collectively entwined futures.
