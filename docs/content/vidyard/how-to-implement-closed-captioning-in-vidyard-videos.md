# How to Implement Closed Captioning in Vidyard Videos

Before diving into the step-by-step process of adding closed captioning to your Vidyard videos, let's begin with a little trip down memory lane. It was a typical Tuesday afternoon, and I found myself staring at my screen, sipping cold coffee. Janet from our marketing team dropped by my desk, clearly on a caffeine high, eager to enhance accessibility in our video content. Her enthusiasm was infectious - it was like being swept up in a friendly tornado. She asked about closed captioning on Vidyard, of which, admittedly, I knew very little. This began our exploration journey, which wasn't just about adding text to videos but embracing a heartwarming connection to make our content accessible to everyone.

As Janet and I muddled through the process, we realized there's a certain chemistry to this task. It's part science, part art. One misstep, and everything spills over like an over-boiled pot of pasta. Let's dive into the step-by-step guide, powered by our early trials—and errors—which, I bet, will help you glide through the process with more grace than our first attempt.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Closed Captions

### Step 1: Preparation is Key

Before we walk up to Vidyard like we own the place, let’s gather all essentials. You’ll need your video file—duh—ready to upload and a corresponding subtitle file in `.srt` format. Think of it as getting your ducks in a quirky row; otherwise, it’s like dressing for the theater and forgetting your ticket.

Reflecting back on our day of prep, Janet and I laughed at how we sat overcomplicating the task, drowning in spreadsheet hell when simplicity was staring us in the face. So, keep it simple.

### Step 2: Upload Your Video to Vidyard

Once we learned not to overthink step one, moving forward was like a cool breeze. Head over to your Vidyard account—just like bumping into an old friend—and click the "Upload" button. Choose your desired video file, and voila, you're halfway there. Just ensure your internet connection isn't playing hide and seek.

Janet might've done an impromptu jig as we managed to upload the video without breaking anything. Celebrate small victories, maybe even with a spontaneous living room dance.

### Step 3: Locate the Video on Your Dashboard

Now, find your freshly uploaded masterpiece on the Vidyard dashboard. It should be resting there proudly, like your favorite book on a bookshelf. Click on the video title, bringing you to the back end—where all the magic hides.

Funny thing, we clicked around like squirrels searching for acorns, but eventually, the navigation felt quite intuitive.

### Step 4: Access the Caption Settings

Ah, the caption settings—a hidden treasure chest within Vidyard, only a click away. You'll find the "Captions" tab; click it like you're opening a treasure map. This nostalgia takes me back to those time-intensive board games. Bingo!

Janet and I often argue if closed captions are the underrated heroes of media. She wins the argument most times, with evidence.

### Step 5: Upload Your Caption File

Time to introduce your `.srt` file to its new Vidyard home. Click on the option to upload your captions and choose the `.srt` file you meticulously crafted—or found. Instantaneously, you'll watch your video put on a new, slightly fuller coat.

Janet was our scribe, dedicating hours to perfecting the subtitles. A noble cause, like adding the final touches to a painting.

### Step 6: Preview and Test

When your words loom on-screen in perfect harmony with the dialogue, life's small challenges seem suddenly conquerable. You need to make sure the timing isn’t off—like dialogue speaking before the actor’s lips move, which is always unsettling.

Janet and I did a live caption test, pausing frames like judges critique art, aiming for perfection. Double-check like you double-knot shoes before a marathon.

### Step 7: Publish and Share

With a wide grin—possibly a victorious fist pump—hit publish. The world is now a slightly better place, accessible and cozy in its inclusivity. Share the link with your comrades, letting them in on the vivid captions experience - even those who pretend they despise movies with subtitles.

Our teamwork bore fruit. And by fruit, I mean perfectly captioned videos. It’s like that feeling when your pet plant blossoms unexpectedly.

## Conclusion: More Than Just Words

As we close this how-to on a warm note, implementing closed captions is more than ticking a box; it’s like inviting everyone into the storytelling circle. It becomes an act of kindness—a shared human connection. And reflects a touch of Janet's irresistible energy to make digital spaces welcoming for all.

We learned that accessibility should dance through our projects naturally. This task, driven by mistakes-turned-insights, teaches us that even if it feels technical, it’s humans reaching out to other humans. Like when Janet offered me a cookie after our caption triumph. Simple joy, shared.

So go ahead. Make your Vidyard videos something everyone can feel a part of - a harmonious medley of image and text that anyone can access, akin to a universal song. 

And remember, if ever the process bogs you down, imagine us—Janet and I—encouraging you from afar in spirited camaraderie, cheering on every captioned syllable.
