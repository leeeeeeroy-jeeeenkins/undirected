# How to Use Vidyard GoVideo for Remote Selling

Ah, the memories of our first virtual sales pitch. It was a bright Tuesday. We were nervous wrecks, the kind of emotional turmoil that makes you check your email 12 times just to make sure you didn’t mess up the timing. We armed ourselves with Vidyard GoVideo—a tool that promised to revolutionize our remote selling capabilities. That day, the technology didn’t just alter how we connected with clients; it redefined our approach to the art of selling itself.

## The Leap from Cold Calls to Warm Videos

Before we knew the magic of Vidyard, sales were all about cold calls, awkward pauses, and that nauseating feeling of unknowingly interrupting someone’s dinner. But once we dipped our toes into the digital storytelling waters of the Vidyard sea, everything changed. Suddenly, sales didn’t feel like selling; it felt like sharing a story.

So, let’s walk through this together: how do we launch and wield Vidyard GoVideo like virtual sales maestros?

### Getting Started: Your First Video

First things first. It’s like setting a scene before we narrate our tales: we have to sign up. Head over to Vidyard’s website—an avenue of limitless potential—and sign up if you haven’t yet. It’s straightforward, a few clicks here and there, kind of like getting into a comfy pair of shoes.

**Downloading the Extension:** 
Vidyard GoVideo operates best as a Chrome extension. To download, simply search “Vidyard GoVideo extension” on the Chrome Web Store. Click ‘Add to Chrome.’ Trust me, the tool will feel like a freshly sharpened pencil, ready to glide on a blank page. After you install it, we’ll see a small Vidyard icon nestled in the upper right corner of our browser.

### Capturing: Setting the Stage

Oh, the thrill of recording! Who knew a tiny camera icon could symbolize infinite possibilities? Click the little Vidyard icon, and a host of options unfold before us, like a menu at a fancy restaurant that we’re totally underdressed for—but in the best way.

**Choosing Your Recording Mode:** 
We can decide between several options: screencast + camera, screencast alone, or just us in front of the camera. Sometimes, all it takes is our voice and face to connect with a potential client. We remember that one time, Rosie—our invariable skeptic client— was sold on our presentation solely because of our visible excitement. Never underestimate the power of a genuine expression.

**Environment:**
Before we even hit record, let's have a quick look around—real life meets digital presentation. Our background should whisper (not yell) productivity. We get rid of last night’s chipped mugs or the laundry basket creeping in the corner. A nifty trick: good lighting elevates every recording. Face the window, or use a lamp to banish those ghostly shadows.

### Recording: The Big Moment

It’s go-time. We take a deep breath, our heart a rhythmic drumbeat. While hovering over the ‘record’ button, we picture our audience on the other side—curious, distracted, maybe contemplating buying cookies instead of software. Here’s how we reel them in:

**Engage with Purpose:**
Start with a bang. Not literally, of course, but something that hooks. “Here’s why you will love what I’m about to show you...” Grab them with the first 10 seconds, because humans, in general, have goldfish-level attention spans.

**Be Yourself:**
A script can sometimes be as stiff and awkward as hugging a mailbox. More often than not, the best sales pitches are unscripted chats where authenticity shines. We stumbled once by going off-script, but the laughter that ensued sealed the deal.

### Getting It Out There: Sharing Your Masterpiece

Hit stop. Post-recording, it’s like when the credits roll after an Oscar-worthy performance—it’s both satisfying and slightly nerve-wracking. We already have our video link, ready and eager to meet our clients’ inboxes.

**Edit Your Thumbnail:**
You’d be surprised how a well-chosen thumbnail is like a smile that turns a stranger into a friend. Select an inviting image—it sets the stage before anyone even clicks ‘play.’

**Email or Embed:**
GoVideo allows us to share directly via email or embed videos into presentations. We hover over the ‘share’ button, choose our weapon of delivery, and boom—it’s in their inbox, waiting to dazzle.

### Follow-Up: The Art of Connection 

Once our video goes out into the wild—emails or presentations—it’s essential to follow-up. We can see if they watched the video, which parts they loved, and where they may have drifted off (probably when we started saying every acronym known to humankind).

**Analytics:**
Vidyard GoVideo grants us the power of video insights. Watching our clients' watch history, we began to understand what they craved and what they yawned over. This info lets us tailor our approaches like master tailors fitting bespoke suits.

### Continuous Improvement: Dabbling in Iterations 

Using Vidyard GoVideo is not a one-and-done type of gig. Like any art form, remote selling needs honing. We went from awkwardly rehearsing in front of mirrors to comfortably chatting as if our laptops were trusted confidants. And each iteration of our videos became better, sharper, and more resonant.

We faced a realization during a conversation with Oliver, our tech advisor, who put it so nicely: "Every video is a draft, not a verdict." The constant renewal is invigorating. 

### Conclusion: The New Frontier of Selling

And so, we've completed our whimsical journey with Vidyard GoVideo. It’s become the parchment for our stories, the canvas for our art, and in many ways, the bridge connecting us to clients. There’s poetry in the digital dialogue and genuine warmth in the connective possibilities it opens. The future of selling is a visual tapestry, and we’re here to bring our stories to life.

Let’s continue sharing, selling, and succeeding—one video at a time.
