# How to Maximize Customer Feedback with Vidyard Surveys

Let’s rewind to last summer, a hot, sticky afternoon in July, when I found myself tangled up in the concept of customer feedback. Our beloved team, caffeinated and slightly delirious from trying to understand how to capture our customers’ real thoughts, decided to embark on the quest to utilize Vidyard’s survey features. 

## The Lightbulb Moment

It was Amanda, the voice of reason wrapped up in a cheerful demeanor, who whispered (loudly) the brilliant idea as she twirled around the room: why not use video surveys to gather the feedback we desperately needed? We all looked at each other, the idea slowly settling in, and almost in unison, lightbulbs pinged above our heads. 

Why Vidyard? Because videos speak louder than words, or surveys for that matter. Unlike a wall of text, videos capture nuance, expression, and tone that static surveys can’t. They invite engagement through sights and sounds. Our plan was set into motion; we would dive into Vidyard head-first, determined to unlock every corner of its potential. 

## Setting Up the Stage

Imagine our joy, and slight confusion, as we logged into Vidyard for the first time. Navigating through the platform was akin to wandering through a new city, every corner promising to reveal a secret or two. Let me take you on the journey that followed.

### Step 1: Login and Familiarize 

We created an account – a necessary evil but easy enough. We then explored Vidyard's dashboard, clicking on every widget, some reluctant navigation that turned delightful as we understood where everything sat. It felt like understanding the first few notes of a new song: foreign yet infinitely promising. 

### Step 2: Create a Video

Now, Amanda's idea called for videos so creating one was naturally next. For product feedback, we recorded a simple, warm message, inviting honest opinions. Here’s the part where creativity takes charge – the delivery. Our goofy team naturally fell into a rhythm of eye-catching intros and helpful transitions. Pro tip: keep it real but be brief. No one wants to watch a feature-length film about survey questions. 

```markdown
**How to Record a Video on Vidyard:**
1. Click `Record` on the Vidyard dashboard.
2. Choose `Screen and Camera` or `Camera Only` as desired.
3. Include a clear and personable intro – remember to smile!
4. Outline the key points or questions succinctly.
5. Hit `Stop Recording` when done. Magic!
```

## Asking the Right Questions

Oh, the art of question-crafting. Our initial attempts were bloated, full of unnecessary pomposity. Until Jake, the quiet thinker among us, suggested simplicity: “What did this product solve for you?” Simple, open-ended. 

### Step 3: Incorporate Questions

Vidyard allows embedding of questions directly into the video – interactive goodies! We sprinkled these questions at just the right moments, like seasoning in a delicate soup. Balance was key, ensuring engagement without overwhelm was crucial.

```markdown
**Adding Questions to Video:**
1. Click on your uploaded video.
2. Navigate to `Edit Video` and choose `Add Chapter`.
3. Type your question in the `Chapter Title` field.
4. Place it at the precise video moment using the timeline below.
5. Hit `Save`. Voilà!
```

## Remembering the Feedback Loop

Surveys without follow-up are like unanswered love letters. We wanted to talk back, to keep the dialogue going. Thus, feedback loops – connections wrapped in warmth and appreciation. 

### Step 4: Respond and Iterate

Feedback collected, we categorized and analyzed with the enthusiasm of a caffeinated detective, identifying patterns and connecting dots. But the real kicker? Sharing what we learned and then acting on it. It turns out, customers really appreciate it when you show you’re listening.

## Embracing Imperfection

Even in our somewhat chaotic approach, there was a method to the madness. Mistakes were made, and we learned from each one, laughing through our mishaps. Take Adrian’s unintended blooper that turned into the most liked part of our video – who knew? 

## The Reward: Engagement and Insight

We realized how Vidyard's video surveys had transformed a one-sided monologue into a rich dialogue. The feedback was deeper, more authentic, more ‘us’. Our understanding of our audience evolved, like the plot twist you never saw coming. 

With each survey, the relationship between us and our customers rooted deeper, not just through analytics, but in the human connection of seeing and hearing one another across the screen. 

So there you have it, our eccentric tale of leveraging Vidyard for customer feedback. In the end, it was all about curiosity, a little trial-and-error, and a sprinkle of good humor. As we cherish each laugh and every lesson, we invite you to embark on your own adventure of discovery, unlocking the potential of video surveys to deepen your customer connections. 

Whether it’s Amanda, Jake, Adrian, or anyone really – it’s about all of us in this together, navigating the world of customer insight, with Vidyard as our trusty guide. 

Happy surveying, fellow adventurers!
