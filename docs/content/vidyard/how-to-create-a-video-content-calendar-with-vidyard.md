# How to Create a Video Content Calendar with Vidyard

It was one of those typical Tuesdays that creep up on you with the stealth of a cat afraid to make its presence known. You know the kind—that day where I’d double-booked meetings, committed to a spontaneous lunch with an old college friend (because reunion sentiments had tugged at my heartstrings), and promised myself to finally stay on top of my video content, which had been languishing like a wilted plant forgotten in the corner of a room.

We had a flash of genius after digesting a delightful sandwich—grilled cheese paired with a soul-hugging tomato soup—at least for our inner video creator. “What if,” we pondered aloud, “we use Vidyard to manage this chaos?” And thus, the idea of creating a video content calendar—our metaphorical watering can—was hatched. It sparked a journey, one deserving to be shared with the world—or with at least those willing to listen or read.

## The Epiphany: A Structured Chaos

As we leaned back in our chairs, staring at that mess of ideas scribbled on napkins—napkins with suspicious tomato blotches—we realized what we needed wasn’t just a random dump of video ideas onto a spreadsheet. Oh no. We needed a system. Something that could tame our swirling cyclone of concepts into a well-organized stream of creative output. Enter Vidyard: our trusty sidekick on this quest to vanquish chaos.

Creating a video content calendar with Vidyard was about as life-changing as discovering sliced bread in a world filled only with loaves. Allow us to unravel this tale of transformation.

### Step 1: Embrace Vidyard's Dashboard

Dive into Vidyard's dashboard like a kid at the deepest end of a swimming pool. It's here that your journey starts, dear traveler, and is the heart of where our wandering minds became calm, organized beings.

- **Log In or Sign Up**: Open Vidyard, and if you haven’t already, create an account. The first step is always the hardest but trust us, this one is as painless as they come.
- **Familiarize Yourself with the Layout**: It’s a bit like getting comfortable with a new room, figuring out where the light switches and comforting corners are. Navigate through the tabs and widgets. Look at the analytics, video library, and integrations.

We remember our first feelings of trepidation exploring this dashboard. My usual excitement was seasoned with confusion. But, much like discovering there exists a method in every madness, the clarity soon unfolded.

### Step 2: Craft Your Calendar

An epiphany struck as we scrolled through our Vidyard account: why don't we create themes for each month? You see, deciding themes was akin to setting the tempo of a symphony. Each note falls into place when you’ve already decided what rhythms to follow.

- **Identify Your Core Themes**: Choose a focus area for each week or month. Are we educating? Entertaining? Selling? Do we bring viewers along small skits of drama? Make this your mantra: every theme needs purpose.
- **Create a Schedule**: This is where colors and dates weaving magical synchronization come into play. Map out your video releases. Use a separate calendar tool if needed—yes, it's okay to cheat a bit here using a calendar app synchronized with Vidyard’s scheduling.

Our colorful calendar resembled a box of mismatched crayons. Chaos with a touch of organization, and frankly, it looked like a rainbow exploded, but it was our rainbow.

### Step 3: Leverage Vidyard Features

Vidyard isn't just a canvas; it's your artistic muse that provides more brushes than you ever imagined needing.

- **Interactive Elements**: Add some spice to your calendar entries by outlining interactive elements. Think calls-to-action, embedded forms, or clickable links. Every feature, every tool acts like spices enhancing your dish—a friendly kick of curry or the subtle sweetness of honey.
- **Video Analytics**: Use analytics like a seasoned cartographer plots a map. Understanding what's resonating guides your video creativity. Take note of view counts, engagement rates, and viewer drop-off points.

Soon enough, Vidyard wasn’t simply an assistant, it was a partner. It whispered data decryption secrets that truly helped refine our content.

### Step 4: Collaborate With Your Team

By now, our content calendar in Vidyard started to look less like a haphazard list and more like a majestic tapestry woven from the finest threads.

- **Invite Your Team**: Welcoming collaborators into your plan is like inviting family to a (semi-filled) pantry—share ideas, enthusiasm, and the occasional video pizza party.
- **Assign Tasks**: Using integrations and tools, it's easy to assign roles or big goals. It's something akin to distributing spoons at a soup kitchen.

I always found working on video projects a solo effort, much like how one braves icy waters alone. But believe me, bringing others along adds warmth and faster swimming strokes.

### Step 5: Review and Adjust Regularly

The final move in our Vidyard dance routine is the encore performance of meticulously reviewing and adapting our crafted plans.

- **Quarterly Reviews**: Set up times for regular appraisal of your content calendar akin to treasuring the quarterly report of laughter counts. Ensure that every content theme is achieving its purpose.
- **Adjust as Needed**: Be flexible. Don't just stick to plans like chewing gum stuck under a desk. Pivot, shift, and realign your strategy as new insights emerge.

By this point, making changes on the fly felt as natural as stretching in the morning. We were no longer guided solely by old plans, but by the insights we uncovered through Vidyard.

## Conclusion: The Beauty of Organization

And so, there we were—no longer slaves to chaos and spaghetti-thrown-against-the-wall schedules. Our Vidyard venture was as refreshing as that first cup of morning coffee—aromatic, energizing, and utterly satisfying. Creating a video content calendar with Vidyard isn’t just a process or a whim—it’s a relationship. And much like any of the best relationships, it requires nurturing, attention, and a pinch of good humor.

Someday—maybe on another ordinary Tuesday—you might find yourself whispering to your inner creative beast, “It’s not YOU, it’s ME; I needed Vidyard to get through you!” And the beast will nod and take a nap, knowing the ordeal of chaos has been tamed.

Remember, friends, we’ve journeyed from the skepticism of a chaotic content strategy to the exhilarating realm of structure and purpose. With Vidyard and a bit of persistence, may all your content be synchronized, well-planned, and ever delightful. Use it as your vessel for the greatest video journeys of all time—or at least the surprisingly productive Tuesday afternoons.
