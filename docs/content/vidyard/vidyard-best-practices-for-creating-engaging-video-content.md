# Vidyard Best Practices for Creating Engaging Video Content

I remember the first time I saw a truly engaging video. It was a brisk Saturday morning, and there I was, huddled under my old, plaid blanket—coffee in one hand, tablet in the other—working my way through what was essentially an endless stream of bland corporate videos. You know the type, right? The ones that make you feel like you're trapped in an eternal webinar loop, and no one can hear your cries for caffeine? But then—BAM!—like a comet blazing across a mundane sky, there was this one video that managed to capture not just my attention, but my imagination. It was lively, quirky, and somehow it spoke directly to ME. That moment was a turning point, and I thought: why can’t all videos achieve this magic mix of science and art?

Years later, as we find ourselves navigating the exciting world of video content creation with tools like Vidyard, my Saturday morning epiphany has become the guiding principle for every project we embark on. But crafting engaging content isn’t magic—it's a series of deliberate choices. Let's dive in.

## The Rendezvous with Storytelling

Ah, storytelling—the art of weaving facts into an enchanting narrative. Think of it as an espresso shot for your content. I remember sharing a casual brunch with Randy, our storytelling genius, whose anecdotes were never a second less than riveting. "Relate to people," he'd say while dunking a croissant into his latte. With Vidyard, we harness this by crafting compelling stories, using characters (even if they're hypothetical), and scenarios that resonate.

First step? Identify your narrative arc. Ask yourself, what's the journey here? Who are the characters? Whether you're promoting a new gadget or detailing the evolution of sourdough—niche interests are our thing—there's a narrative route to explore. Plan your storyline with:

- **Beginning:** Grab attention immediately—sometimes a playful jumpcut or a relatable quote does the trick.
- **Middle:** Develop intrigue with twists. Make viewers ask, "What's next?"
- **End:** Always leave them with a call to action or a poignant thought.

As we experienced with Randy's croissant-laden wisdom, it’s this structure that breathes life into otherwise mundane content.

## Keeping it REAL With Authenticity

Fast forward to another memorable moment, a casual rainy afternoon chat with Clara—our social media maven. "People have a sixth sense for phony," she said, as rain drizzled melodically outside. It struck a chord. Authenticity is king, especially in a world brimming with polished perfection. Vidyard provides us with the means to present our genuine selves.

Here's how to embrace the rawness:

- **Show your face, not a facade:** Engage your audience as if you're talking to a dear friend. Speak clearly, warmly, and punctuated with humor if it's your vibe.
- **Be human:** Mistakes are part of life. Leave in a flub or two—they humanize your brand and make you relatable.
- **Candid moments:** Share behind-the-scenes clips or bloopers; they often enhance a story more than meticulously planned scenes.

Remember, sincerity is the secret ingredient in this digital casserole. And like Clara’s insightful conversations, it’s authenticity that forms the foundation of trust between creator and audience.

## Dynamism Through Visuals and Sounds

Spontaneity thrives on rainy Sunday escapades, like that epic road-trip we took with Lucas—audio aficionado extraordinaire—where we discovered the power of sound. Videos on Vidyard gain a heartbeat with the right visuals and sound. Let’s sprinkle some life into them.

- **Visual variety:** Use close-ups, wide angles, and rapid transitions to maintain interest. Motion graphics or text overlays add layers of dynamism.
- **Sound matters:** Choose a soundtrack that complements your theme—Lucas taught us the art of silence, sometimes less is more.
- **Mix up the pace:** A sudden change in music tempo or visual speed can reel viewers back if their attention starts to wane.

Lucas’s love for ambient tunes taught us that every frame should be thoughtful, each sound intentional.

## Interactive Elements: Engage on a Deeper Level

There was a day sitting by the lake when Mia, an interactive design wizard, told us, "Make them part of the conversation." Just like she wanted ducks to swim up to her (they didn't, but at least she tried), we need our audience to interact with our stories. Vidyard’s built-in interaction tools make it possible.

- **Clickable calls-to-action (CTAs):** Direct your viewers what's next—whether it's a deeper dive, a sign-up, or even just a "thumbs up."
- **Gated content:** To entice deeper engagement, offer exclusive content or early access behind a simple sign-up wall.
- **Decision points:** Allow viewers to choose the journey, crafting an interactive story where they decide the outcome.

Mia's enthusiasm for audience engagement transformed the way we use these elements to foster a more profound connection.

## Craft the Perfect Conclusion

As the sun set on another long, creative day, I recalled a gentle nudge from Julian—our editor savant. "The ending should echo long after it’s over," he mused while editing the exact right soundbite at the end of our latest project. It taught me that every story deserves a proper send-off.

- **Wrap it with grace:** Summarize the journey. Reflect the opening, leaving the audience satisfied but pondering.
- **Memorable outro:** A catchy, or reflective end-screen can lend gravitas and lend itself to being memorable—an unexpected question or amusing quirk makes good fodder.

Think of Julian when you close your videos with Vidyard. Send viewers off with something meaningful, just as he'd carefully do.

## Conclusion

Our journey through the tapestry of video content creation brings us here—to a world where each video is not just a message, but a reflection of who we are, who we're striving to be. Vidyard offers the paintbrush, yet it's our unique stories that color the canvas. We've paralleled strategy with serendipitous lessons learned in the most ordinary days of our lives: mornings under blankets, brunches, rainy chats, lakeside reflections. These are our stories, and this is how we tell them—with heart, authenticity, and a sprinkle of nostalgic joy.

May your adventures in video creation be as enlightening and engaging as those timeless Saturday mornings. Let's go make something worth watching.
