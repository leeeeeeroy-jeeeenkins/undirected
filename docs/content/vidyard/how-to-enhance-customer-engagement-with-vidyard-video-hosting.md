# How to Enhance Customer Engagement with Vidyard Video Hosting

Ah, the sweet aroma of burnt popcorn wafting through the office. That was how our Thursday mornings usually began in the marketing department. I'm sure you relate to that one person who never seems to get the microwave timing right, like our dear Charlie. But some good came from it; while the popcorn fiasco unfolded, Carla, our tech whisperer, popped over, clutching her laptop like a knight bearing an enchanted sword. Her eyes sparkled – genuine electricity – and she practically buzzed with excitement. "Guys," she said, with the suspense of an old-time movie announcer. "I’ve discovered Vidyard. We need to use it to revamp our customer engagement!"

Our conversation that day sparked the topic of this article – how to enhance our connection with customers using Vidyard. We all sat there, spellbound, as Carla unraveled the magic of this tool. Let's delve into our shared discovery, shall we?

## Discovering the Power of Video

The bread and butter of businesses isn't just dry bread – it's icing-covered cinnamon buns. Engaging with our customers in a meaningful way transforms our bland toast into a vibrant platter. Videos, we learned, are the expressive butter on our buns. A relatable medium, considering our daily routine featured clicking 'play' more times than we could count. The joy of storytelling through video was like tossing colors onto a blank canvas.

When Carla introduced us to Vidyard, we were like kids in a candy store. Who knew our marketing endeavors could be filled with such joy? Whether you’re sending a video email to potential clients or crafting an attention-grabbing social media post, video makes the engagement personal, almost like pulling customers into our cozy living room for a fireside chat.

## Setting Up Vidyard: Getting Past the Initial Hiccups

Remember that time you tried setting up IKEA furniture without a manual? Vidyard’s setup really wasn’t that chaotic, but it did initially remind us of that chaotic Saturday afternoon. Here’s a step-by-step to sidestep those initial hurdles:

### Step 1: Creating Your Vidyard Account

Even Janice, who forgot her own Netflix password, managed to create an account here. Head to [Vidyard's website](https://www.vidyard.com/) and slap that 'Sign Up' button. Enter your work email, create a shiny new password, and voilà – you're in!

### Step 2: Navigating the Dashboard

Upon entry, we found ourselves staring at the dashboard like explorers in a new land. Fear not! The interface is more intuitive than it might first seem. Our tech-maestro Carla guided us through the dashboard – consider it the cockpit of your spaceship, ready to launch videos into the vastness of the internet.

### Step 3: Uploading Your First Video

Bobby, with his notorious knack for breaking things, found this straightforward. Click on the 'New Video' button and either upload a pre-recorded video from your device or record one directly. We uploaded an infamous video of Charlie's ‘Popcorn Chronicles’ – relatable content is key.

### Step 4: Personalizing & Customizing

Vidyard isn’t just about the generic. We added our branding – Carla called it ‘Adding the family crest.’ Click on 'Custom Player' to incorporate your logo and colors; branding makes customers feel connected at a glance.

## Crafting the Message That Resonates

Once you've infiltrated the realm of Vidyard, it's not just about aesthetic uploads but the stories they tell. We needed content that sang like our office karaoke sessions, soulful yet slightly off-key.

### Personal Touches Matter

Imagine every video like a conversation over warm apple pie. Personalization is paramount. Carla suggested using features like 'Video Personalization' to include client's first names or details. This element made many audiences feel like they were in on our inside jokes.

### Engaging Thumbnails: The Book Covers

Our first attempt at creating thumbnails wasn't a masterpiece. Don't do a ‘Bobby’ by just taking any random freeze-frame. Thumbnails are the siren calls of your video – making people click. Take advantage of Vidyard’s ‘Thumbnail Creator’ tool to craft an inviting visual.

## Analyzing Engagement: Where Data Meets Delight

After getting those videos out - like ships setting sail - tracking their journeys is essential. Vidyard made this as delightful as sipping bubble tea on a summer afternoon.

### Step 5: Embrace the Analytics

Remember playing detective with a magnifying glass as kids? Us neither. But Vidyard's analytics provided a similar thrill. Navigate to your video’s analytics to spy on view counts, completion rates, and viewer demographics. This is where your video’s secret diary is revealed.

### Refining Future Content

With this data, marketing transforms into a two-person salsa. You lead, and the data follows, informing every step - turning our future video endeavors into masterful performances, just like our office talent shows.

## Building Stronger Bonds: We’re All in This Together

The best part about Vidyard wasn’t just engaging customers. It was how we, as a team, came together -  like a family puzzle on a rainy day. We shared stories, laughed at our mistakes, and celebrated our wins.

### Collaborating with Teams

Vidyard allows seamless collaboration within teams, as seamlessly as passing popcorn at our movie nights. From coordinating strategies to synchronizing our branding, it was like composing a symphony with every team member contributing their unique instruments.

### Fostering Community

The tool fortified our connections not only with our audience but internally. We enjoyed creating engaging videos, knowing that somewhere, someone appreciated our quirks.

## Wrapping it Up with a Bow

Before us lay the now-natural aroma of successfully enhanced customer engagement. Vidyard brought us closer to our audience in ways we hadn't imagined, and the unexpected outcome – fostering a more cohesive team. Much like the notorious burned popcorn, it started as something simple and transformed into a memorable experience.

In the end, we’re more than just marketers; we’re storytellers inviting others into our world. And Vidyard was the perfect script.
