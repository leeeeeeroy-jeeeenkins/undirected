# Case Studies of Brands Succeeding with Vidyard

Picture this: my phone buzzes in the middle of a mellow Saturday morning—coffee half-sipped and the world just waking up outside my window. It’s Jess from marketing, wide-eyed about something called Vidyard. You ever get a text from a friend about an app or a platform and you scratch your head, going, "Vid-yard? What kind of feral digital creature have they discovered now?" But Jess, bless her persistent heart, insists it’s the golden ticket to unleashing video magic. So we embark on this Vidyard adventure, dragging along coffeemaker and skepticism, to see where it would lead brands with a vision.

## **Bright Beginnings with Banana Republic**

Fast forward a few months, and I'm sipping cortados with our old pals at Banana Republic. Video had always been their Achilles' heel—they stumbled through clunky processes like a toddler learning to walk in dad’s shoes. But with Vidyard? Oh, they started dancing.

I remember Sarah, their digital wizard, spinning stories about the transformation. "We just pointed, clicked, and sent!" she'd exclaim, grinning ear-to-ear. No more cumbersome uploads to platforms that demanded sacrifices and rituals just to get a thumbnail right—which forever haunt us in our digital nightmares. Instead, Vidyard empowered their team to shoot and share videos right from their emails. They sprinkled personalized video sprinkles throughout their customer service interactions and marketing strategies. People love seeing a real person, and that connection amped up their click-through rates like you wouldn't believe.

Sarah laughed over her latte, recounting a specific campaign "We titled it 'What to Wear to Your Next Zoom Party'—ridiculous, right? But spurred on by the walking, talking joy of our own staffy coworkers in our videos." The campaign exploded, subscribers turned into loyal fans, casting aside the boring old text emails for vibrant visual treats.

## **Echoes of Enthusiasm at Expedia**

Then there was Expedia—a behemoth grappling with choppy seas of customer inquiries. It felt as if they were on a never-ending quest, each call a sword battle with a nightmarish hydra named Customer Service. Toss Vidyard into this swirling mix, and suddenly, the tempest calmed.

Once, during a spirited Zoom call, Emily from their team shared a vignette that stuck with me. "We received this message from Linda, a customer, who was practically singing praises—through email no less!" Emily chuckled. Linda related her grand misadventure with a flight inquiry which was transformed from a dreary FAQ rabbit hole to a tailored video solution narrated by a friendly Expedia rep. Linda appreciated not having to decipher an endless stream of text and instead watched a smiling face resolve her issue in under two minutes.

Vidyard gave Expedia the tools to transform labyrinthine processes into user-friendly video maps. Video content optimized into bite-sized solutions—much like finding the last piece of pizza hidden in the box. It was game-changing for their support metrics, reducing call times and increasing customer smiles—a brilliant metric no one tells you about.

## **Creating Culinary Connections with Chef’s Plate**

Our Vidyard tale next leads us to the delicious world of Chef's Plate. Achieving culinary conquest outside a simple recipe card seemed far-fetched until, of course, you add video. Vidyard became their sous-chef, whisking their audience into engaging video recipes.

Tucked away in their airy office, Evan showed me a recent video—a how-to guide to mastering the elusive art of soufflé. "Our customers were licking their screens," Evan quipped. They designed the endeavor like a Netflix series, building suspense and allure in a medium designed for quick access.

Customers gobbled up these video recipes like digital macarons—pleasant, nicely packaged, and leaving you wanting more. By integrating Vidyard, Chef's Plate crafted a community around the joy of home cooking, connecting with customers beyond transactional exchanges. Instead of mere ingredients, they served passion and culture which, funnily enough, also boosted their sales and brand reputation like a tried-and-true combo.

## **Gamifying Learning with GitHub**

And then, there was GitHub. Stereotypically serious, like a professor at a lectern, painstakingly explaining algorithms to glazed-eyed students. Could Vidyard lighten the digital workload even for a hub as technical as this? Short answer: absolutely.

Together, we navigated the idea during a brainstorming session—nourished by black coffee and brain food any geek loves: donuts. They wanted to create a community of engaged developers who learned not from monotonous webinars but from exciting, digestible videos that turned coding challenges into shared victories.

Brad, their head of community engagement, helmed the effort introducing short and punchy video tutorials. "We wanted to speak directly to devs, turn code documentation into 'aha!' moments," Brad explained, waving his hands like an animated character in a comic strip. Developers discovered solutions sitting right under their noses, thanks to personalized and clear video content, which, contrary to popular belief, can be as entertaining as it is educational.

GitHub saw attendance at their virtual events soar, feedback was roared—and happy developers, much like kittens after a nap, were much more cooperative and engaged.

## **Impact Reflections With Our Brewed Wisdom**

Reflecting on these Vidyard adventures, it struck us how video, coupled with passion, could transform a brand's story into an epic as memorable as Tolstoy (well, almost!). Sure, each company had their unique challenges and wildly different audiences. Yet, the common thread wasn't just about jumping on a new digital bandwagon. It was about spinning tales in a way that was vibrant, accessible, and deeply human.

Brands like Banana Republic, Expedia, Chef's Plate, and GitHub understood the core of connection—the beating heart of their enterprises—which is, ultimately, people reaching out to people with genuine smiles, helping hands, and shared excitement over the wonders their products could offer. Vidyard was simply the dexterous virtuoso turning these simple interactions into veritable symphonies.

And in our little corner of the world—with empty coffee cups echoing our triumph—we realized something profound. Video is more than a medium; it’s a meeting ground, a stage where relationships are fostered and nurtured. If Shakespeare's quill stuffed into our modern digital canvas sounds trivial, remember, every innovative leap starts exactly like this—a whispered idea over coffee, smiles shared, and daring possibilities embraced. Vidyard just happens to be the brush that paints these beautiful panoramas of connections in hues we never knew we could touch.

So go ahead, embrace the Vidyard. Maybe, just maybe, it might also transform your plucky brand into something legendary.
