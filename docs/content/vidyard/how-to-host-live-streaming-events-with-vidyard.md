# How to Host Live Streaming Events with Vidyard

It was a surreal Tuesday afternoon when we first discovered the profound magic of live streaming events. Picture it: an unscripted dance of tech and nerves, all underpinned by Vidyard. Like many, we were skeptical at first, wondering if a platform could really be the bridge to our audience. As it turns out, it not only met our expectations but completely transformed our approach to audience engagement. Now, we find ourselves ardent converts, ready to spread the infectious joy of live streaming.

## Setting the Stage: Preparation is Key

There we were, hearts racing, as Marvin from marketing accidentally spilled iced coffee all over the live stream equipment. It was a moment of frantic laughter and chaos — lessons in the importance of fail-safes were learned. Starting on the right foot means taking those extra steps to ensure everything is ready. Here's the plan:

1. **Choose Your Theme and Platform**: First, nail down what the event is — a product launch, a Q&A session, or maybe it’s Marvin’s new ice-coffee-while-live-streaming stunt show. Then, make sure Vidyard is the best fit for your needs.

2. **Sign Up for Vidyard**: If you haven’t already, create your account. It’s as straightforward as pie, unless you’ve tried baking pie, then it's easier.

3. **Set Objectives and Outline Content**: This isn’t like winging it through a last-minute toast at a wedding. Know what you want to achieve, and map out the steps to get there.

4. **Check Equipment**: Cameras, mics, lights — the usual gang. Make sure they all play nice with Vidyard.

5. **Reliable Internet**: Let’s not depend on the notoriously fickle café Wi-Fi. Ensure your connection can handle the stream.

As you prepare, remember the laughter and chaos of the iced-coffee incident. It’s proof that behind every tech mishap is a story worth telling.

## Getting Into the Groove: Creating Your Event

You’ve prepped like a pro, and now it's time to dive into creating the event, much like the way we jumped into impromptu dance sessions during breaks. Vidyard simplifies this process:

1. **Log Into Vidyard**: Once inside, find your way to the live stream setup.

2. **Create a New Event**: Click ‘New Event,’ which, contrary to Marvin’s beliefs, isn’t a magic trick, but it works like one.

3. **Configure Your Stream Settings**: Choose resolution, privacy settings, and decide on whether you want viewers to chat. (Hint: you do, interactive gigs create the best memories).

4. **Set Up Integrations**: Integrations can include social media platforms or CRMs. It’s like adding extra flavors to your favorite coffee - elevates the experience.

5. **Test Run**: Do a run-through with friends or colleagues. During ours, Marvin took the stage with a tin foil hat. You do you — maybe you need an audience too.

As you set the event, remember the joy of sharing the stage, even with imagined props and whimsical ideas.

## Showtime: Broadcasting Like a Pro

The big day; the lights are slightly blinding, and adrenaline is your new best friend. We felt like seasoned performers taking the stage for the first time, yet slightly terrified. With Vidyard, you can handle it:

1. **Go Live**: Click ‘Go Live’ with the exuberance of Marvin seeing a sale on eco-friendly coffee. 

2. **Engage with Your Audience**: Like a seasoned storyteller, interact with comments and feedback in real-time. Vidyard’s tools make this fluid and natural.

3. **Monitor the Stream’s Health**: Keep one eye on performance indicators. Dropouts and lag are like chili in your morning coffee - unwanted surprises. Vidyard provides analytics to help keep things spicy, not scorching.

4. **Adjust on the Fly**: Sometimes tech will be tech. If anything goes sideways, Vidyard's interface allows real-time adjustments.

Embrace the thrill of live performance. Every heartbeat and flustered moment is part of the shared experience, much like those serendipitous days with Marvin.

## Encore and Afterglow: Post-Event Wrap-Up

You did it! Whether it was flawless or a lovable train of happy accidents, the post-event period is just as important. Like any memorable performance, it’s worth reflecting.

1. **Save the Stream**: Make sure the event is saved. Vidyard does this automatically, but Marvin likes to double-check, just in case.

2. **Analyse the Data**: Audience engagement, viewership metrics, and more. Vidyard supplies rich feedback — heavy data lifting included.

3. **Follow Up**: Send thank you notes or highlights to attendees. A touch of gratitude goes a long way in creating lasting connections.

4. **Gather Feedback**: Ask for feedback through surveys or direct outreach. Expect witty remarks and creative critiques that only Marvin could inspire.

Our journey of discovery doesn't end with a live event. It's merely the beginning of deeper engagements, warmer connections, and the occasional unexpected encore — all sculpted through Vidyard's innovative approach to streaming.

*As we pack away our gear, reflecting on each mishap and success, we realize each event teaches us something new. Remember Marvin’s coffee spill? Perhaps it's the happy chaos that reminds us why we dive into these wild, colorful moments.*
