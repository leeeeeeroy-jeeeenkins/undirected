# Advanced Strategies for Scheduling and Resharing Posts with Buffer

---

Have you ever found yourself tangled in a social media snafu, like that time we accidentally posted a picture of Phil's cat—who's incidentally terrified of spiders—thinking it was for Cat Appreciation Day, only to realize it was actually Reptile Awareness Week? Yeah, we've been there. It was in those moments, sipping lukewarm coffee and cringing at the mess, that we realized the need for a smarter game plan in our social media scheduling. Enter: Buffer. Not just a safety net, but our trusty co-pilot in the ever-thrilling flight of online engagement. This article is a deep dive into advanced strategies for scheduling and resharing posts with Buffer, crafted from trials, errors, and a healthy dose of catnip-induced inspiration.

## Discovering the Power of Buffer’s Scheduling

Remember the time we decided to schedule posts for an entire month in one night—you know, because sleep is overrated? We were juggling coffee mugs and calendar dates like circus clowns. Then it hit us: Buffer. The wizardry it holds! A haven for those who fancy their content to be planned, precise, and pristinely laid out.

### Setting Up Buffer for Success

1. **Create Your Buffer Account:**
   - Hop over to [Buffer's website](https://buffer.com) and sign up.
   - Once you're in, connect your social media accounts. Dabble with platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn; they get along well with Buffer.

2. **Customize Your Posting Schedule:**
   - Head to the 'Settings' of each account you've linked.
   - Decide when you want your posts to soar into the digital ether.
   - Fill your schedule with time slots tailored to when your audience is active, or when you're dramatically sipping your morning tea à la Downton Abbey.

3. **Plan Your Posts:**
   - Add new posts to your queue—think of this as the digital train depot sending off content carriages.
   - Mix it up with a blend of text, visuals, and links for a refreshingly diverse social buffet.

The serene feeling of hitting 'Add to Queue' for the first time was akin to watching your little kid finally ride their bike without training wheels.

## The Art of Resharing: Breathing New Life into Old Content

Picture this: We've crafted the perfect post—witty, engaging, meme primo—only to see it fade into the abyss of algorithmic chaos. That's when we learned the poignant art of resharing. It's like bringing out the fine china for unexpected guests—all about timing and presentation.

### How to Reshare Like a Pro

1. **Select the Content Worth Resharing:**
   - Dig into analytics to uncover those hidden gems—posts that captured more hearts than a rom-com protagonist.
   - Identify evergreen content. Posts that provide lasting value; they're not startups—they're the comfy, old recliner chairs of the content world.

2. **Schedule Reshares Strategically:**
   - Head to your Buffer dashboard.
   - Duplicate your top-performing posts.
   - Slot them into your future queues, ensuring you don’t turn into that friend who shares the same story every party. Space it out juuust right.

3. **Tweak for a Fresh Flair:**
   - Slightly alter the wording or image. Keep it fresh, like grandma’s secret spaghetti sauce recipe—not a hint of staleness allowed.
   - Pose a question or add a new hashtag to tap into burgeoning conversations.

During one of our resharing escapades, we discovered a post from two years back about a rubber duck charity event. A quick reshuffle and a hashtag update, and it floated back into relevance with as much buoyancy as ever.

## Advanced Buffer Tactics: Analytics and Team Coordination

Ah, the sweet, nerdy pleasure of diving into analytics. It's in the numbers where innovation flirts with reality, and amidst graphs and charts, strategy is born.

### Making Analytics Work for You

1. **Understand Your Metrics:**
   - Head to the ‘Analytics’ section—not just for ogling numbers.
   - Identify metrics like reach, engagement, and clicks. Decipher which content resonates with your audience like that one song everyone loves but never admits to.

2. **Optimize Posting Times:**
   - Use Buffer’s insights to adjust your posting schedule during high engagement times. Hit the sweet spots—neither too eager nor fashionably late.

### Coordination for Content Cohesion

1. **Establish a Workflow with Your Team:**
   - Use Buffer’s collaboration features to loop in team members—because no one prefers to ride solo on this digital highway.
   - Assign roles, set guidelines, and keep the symphony in harmony. Trust us, when Sally used highbrow literary quotes for a skateboarding event promo, we learned this the hard way.

2. **Editorial Calendar Integration:**
   - Sync your Buffer with editorial calendars to ensure nothing falls through the proverbial cracks.
   - Plan campaigns months in advance—as they say, foresight is the product of creativity and too many planning sessions.

The time we forgot to coordinate and posted a serious article about climate change sandwiched between two frivolous memes taught us the importance of cohesion. Context matters, friends.

## Conclusion: The Carrot at the End of the Buffer Rainbow

From that fateful cat photo mishap to conquering the wild terrain of social platforms with Buffer, we've come a long way. It turns out, with precision scheduling and strategic resharing, there's a certain peace to be found in the chaos of content creation. We've danced through the fields of analytics, arm in arm with foresight, guided by the loyal lantern that is Buffer. So grab your mugs, your calendars, and perhaps your cats. Here's to whittling away the chaos with simple clicks and a dash of strategy.

In the end, it's all about crafting a harmonious blend of new and old, planned and spontaneous. It's about finding joy in the process—about unearthing the perfect moment when a reshared post steals the spotlight, just as the coffee hits the spot. Cheers to the ever-unfolding journey of digital storytelling!
