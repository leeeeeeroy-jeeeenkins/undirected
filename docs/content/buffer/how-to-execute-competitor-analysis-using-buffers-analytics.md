# How to Execute Competitor Analysis Using Buffer’s Analytics

It was a brisk autumn afternoon, leaves crunching underfoot as we strolled through the park, the kind of day that makes you introspective yet energized. My friend Sarah, a seasoned social media manager, suddenly turned to me and said, "Have you ever noticed how we obsess over what others do better rather than perfecting our game?" I nodded, recognizing that sweet dance between curiosity and envy that often plays out in business. That comment set the stage for the heart of our story: mastering competitor analysis with Buffer’s Analytics. By the time our walk ended, the framework of this article began to spark and sizzle with the thrill of exploration.

## Setting the Scene: Embracing the Unknown

The first time I used Buffer, I felt a bit like a kid who just stepped into the biggest candy store ever. Possibilities everywhere. And as it goes with new toys, discovering something new about it every time was inevitable. Now, Buffer isn't just a tool; it's an experience, a gateway to understanding that can turn your strategy on its head—right into success. Think of Buffer’s Analytics as your secret decoder ring for the inscrutable world of social media competition.

We often avoided diving deeply into what others in the field were doing, thinking it was enough to know vaguely that “Company X” was killing it because of some nebulous metric. But what if we could take the red pill and see exactly how they tick? It’s like suddenly hearing the words in a song you've listened to forever.

### Step 1: Dip Our Feet into the Data Pool

You'd think that diving into competitor analysis would require spreadsheets and 16 cups of coffee. Nope. Turns out, Buffer's Analytics offers a more elegant solution. You start by accessing your Buffer dashboard. It's friendlier than you expect, almost like meeting someone who smiles with their eyes. Here’s where the magic starts.

1. **Log into Buffer**: "Blindingly obvious," you say, but remember - this is a shared experience. We land on the dashboard, greeted by a user-interface that feels like a warm hug. No, seriously, it's that welcoming.
   
2. **Locate the Analytics Tab**: Ever play hide-and-seek as a kid? Finding the analytics tab is the easy part of the game. It's prominently displayed on the top navigation bar - Buffer doing its best to say, "This way, explorers."

3. **Select Competitors**: Here's where things start getting exciting. With joyful curiosity, we add our competitors by either searching for their social media handles or URLs. I remembered Sarah saying as she added her rivals, "It’s like inviting them for coffee, but without them knowing it.”

### Step 2: Plunder the Information Treasure Chest

Having selected your frenemies, you will encounter a treasure chest that instead of jewels, contains data. Think of it like "National Treasure," but with less Nicolas Cage and more engagement rates. The sheer thrill!

- **Compare Insights**: Buffer allows you to peer over the fence without trespassing. Feet firmly planted in ethical ground, you can now compare audience growth, engagement rates, and posting frequency. Numbers jump into graphs, as if dancing to a beat, and the music they make tells stories.

  At this point in our analytical escapade, Sarah piped up, "Isn’t it funny how you're not really stealing their strategy? You're just deciphering what we've been blind to." I chuckled, recognizing the truth in her words. Indeed, imitation is the sincerest form of figuring out what works.

- **Content Analysis**: A bit like reading someone's diary—if their diary were a collection of memes and hashtags. We can see which posts' resonate and which are, well, duds. It’s fascinating and humbling to realize how much content doesn’t work even for the best.

### Step 3: Forge Our Victory Strategy

Having danced through data, it's time to forge it into insights that we can wield like Excalibur. Just less physically dangerous. We shift focus from knowing to doing.

- **Apply Findings**: This might just be the step where we reflectively stroke our imagined beards, murmuring "Ah, I see now." Decide which learnings can be directly incorporated not just into your strategy, but your very way of thinking about social media. Maybe you see trends you hadn’t dared envisage. Sarah usually jots down a list of ‘next steps,’ declaring the intangible tangible.

- **Focus on Uniqueness**: While it's intriguing to know what others are doing, it’s essential to remember they are not us, and we are not them. Our vision, that unique mix of madness and creativity, remains ours to harness. As Sarah often quips with a wink, “They may have data, but we have flair.”

### Closure: Reflecting on the Journey

As our walk through the park drew close, the sun dipped below the horizon. It was a fitting end to our conversational voyage. It wasn't just about spying through a virtual keyhole on competitors but about growing wiser through observation. Buffer’s Analytics wasn't just a tool; it felt like an old companion, throwing an arm around your shoulder, guiding you through the labyrinth of competitive data.

This experience was strangely comforting, a heartening reminder that we don't walk our business paths alone. Sarah and I returned to our respective hubs that evening, hands warmed by insights rather than the chill of rivalry.

Now, dear reader, as you stand on the precipice of your own competitor analysis journey, remember: Each step is a moment of learning, every insight a glint of gold in the pan. Embrace it with tenacity and an open heart. There’s magic in data, and sometimes, magic wears the guise of numbers and graphs. Shall we together, embark afresh?
