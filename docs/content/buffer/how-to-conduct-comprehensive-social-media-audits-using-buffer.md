# How to Conduct Comprehensive Social Media Audits Using Buffer

One humid afternoon, as sunlight streamed through the living room window and cast odd shapes on the walls, I found myself sitting on a couch that seemed to have magically sunk an extra inch during my morning breakfast. Why, you ask? Because there I was, pondering the mysteries of the universe and — more urgently — the elusive art of mastering social media audits using Buffer. The digital landscape felt like an overwhelming ocean, and I was a ship seeking the elusive Northwest Passage through it. As I opened Buffer, hesitated a moment over the coffee-stained notebook beside me, and leaped into the great expanse of scheduling dashes and engagement metrics, I reminded myself we were not alone — I had coffee. I had Buffer. And together, we would conquer.

## Set Sail: Understanding Buffer

Let's drift back for a moment. The first time I encountered Buffer, it felt like meeting a superhero who can fly, see through walls, and has a penchant for analyzing spreadsheets. Buffer is our trusty digital sidekick. It unfurls a tidy space where we organize, schedule, and oversee our social media antics. It’s like a benevolent wizard assisting in our quest to become omnipresent online without needing to clone ourselves. The interface is clear, the icons inviting, but don’t be lulled into thinking it’s anything less than powerful. Armed with a feature called Buffer Analyze, we can dive deep into social realms to compile thorough audits.

### Step 1: Taking Stock with Buffer Analyze

Alright, here’s where we begin our meticulous venture. Ensure that Buffer Analyze is activated in your Buffer account. If you have a day where your attention span could rival that of a goldfish, don’t worry — starting is simple. 

1. **Log into Buffer:** Go to the Buffer website and log in. This should be straightforward unless you've forgotten your password, in which case, may the odds be ever in your favor with the password recovery process.
   
2. **Navigate to Analyze:** Now, do a delightful little mouse jig across the screen and click on 'Analyze.' Feel the anticipation tingling in your fingertips. It’s like accessing the brain of a digital oracle.

3. **Choose Your Social Account:** Decide which platform you want to focus on for your audit. Whether it’s the colorful chaos of Instagram or the professional hustle of LinkedIn, select with gusto.

At this moment, as Buffer starts to whirl into action, I am reminded vividly of an ancient game of chess I played against my Uncle Bert. He’s perpetually skeptical of technology, but told me once that honors, fleeting as they are, should be grasped before they slip through your fingers. “Precision and attention to detail,” he’d say. Similarly, our audit requires keen attention as Buffer Analyze showcases metrics ranging from audience engagement to post performance.

### Step 2: Diving into Key Metrics

With Buffer, data doesn’t look like intimidating stressors but more like a row of jars filled with multicolored candies, ready to be savored.

1. **Engagement Overview:** This is where we discover what's working and what's not. Look for likes, shares, comments — all those delightful inklings of interaction that validate our existence.

2. **Content Performance:** Glance over how individual posts are performing. Notice which ones detonate with popularity and which ones sadly whimper into the void.

3. **Audience Growth:** Here is where we track our follower changes over the defined period. Observing those numbers flutter up or, on vexing days, plummet, always feels like a weather vane—it tells us which way the wind blows.

While scoring through these insights, I remembered my high school teacher, Mrs. Thompson, who would often chuckle at her students' despair when graded worksheets were returned. “Numbers tell a story, dear,” she’d muse, “and learning to read them is like cracking a code.” Buffer provided that Rosetta Stone for our social media.

### Step 3: Compare Historical Data

Conducting a social media audit is not just about celebrating current triumphs but about tracking evolution — maybe even slow motion like molasses flowing uphill but still, it moves.

1. **Historical Comparison:** Buffer allows you to compare different time periods. This is the moment you play detective — or maybe time traveler? — parsing data across months to distill trends.

2. **Export Reports:** Click on that inconspicuously powerful 'Export' button to download snazzy graphs and tables. Armed with these, we can craft PowerPoint presentations that dazzle even the most stiff-lipped of corporate stakeholders.

3. **Identify Patterns:** Rummage through the data declaring ah-ha! as you discover patterns. Maybe engagements with videos soar on Tuesdays while photo posts languish during weekends — use this knowledge to shape your strategies.

Needless to say, this exercise conjures memories of last Christmas, when I insisted that Santa's watching (as a joke to my younger cousins) and they diligently plotted “Santa Tracking” on the family Google Map. Shaping content strategies feels a bit like convincing Santa to be more visible on the chosen days. 

### Step 4: Competitor Analysis

A deep sigh as we arrive at an often underappreciated aspect of social media audits — peeking over the neighbor’s fence but in a cool, digital kind of way.

1. **Competitors’ Content Audit:** Find similar accounts, their strategies, their content cadence. This isn’t snooping — it’s gaining insight.

2. **Benchmarking Metrics:** Using Buffer’s Analytics tools, compare how your performance stacks up against competitors. Sometimes painful, often enlightening, always worth it.

3. **Discover Content Gaps:** Identify gaps where your competitor might be excelling and you're not. Grinning at rival successes is optional but keep your focus on growth opportunities instead.

This comparative navel gazing took me back to a particularly competitive family pick-up soccer game where strategies were whispered with great zeal, sidelong glances our only currency.

### Step 5: Refine Strategy and Set Goals

Once the stones have been unturned, it’s time for us to arrange them into the mosaic of a strategy that sings.

1. **Set Reflective Goals:** Based on the audit, craft goals that are SMART — not the “I'm a genius” kind, but Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. It’s like finally figuring out how to impress your childhood pen pal.

2. **Refine Content Strategy:** Adjust your content plan. Prioritize content types, days, or approaches that data suggests have better engagement rates.

3. **Iterate and Innovate:** Social media is no place to rest on laurels. Embrace auditing as an ongoing, lively, ever-evolving tango, not just an occasional shuffle.

Every audit reveals fresh insights, not unlike a late-night pastry, devoured by flashlight, that surprises by being filled with an unexpected pop of lemony zest. After all, when we see our social media presence as an organic, living entity, audits become moments of exhilarating discovery, rather than tedious chores.
