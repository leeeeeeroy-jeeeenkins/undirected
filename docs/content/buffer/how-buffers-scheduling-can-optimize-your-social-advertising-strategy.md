# How Buffer’s Scheduling Can Optimize Your Social Advertising Strategy

Let me tell you about this one beautiful, chaotic morning. It was the kind of morning where breakfast was just a quick slurp of cold coffee and an inhale of cereal dust. My social media was, quite literally, a circus act. Posts were overdue, captions half-written, and the meat of my workday was to be spent missing deadlines instead of meeting them. We've all had those days, right? You know, the "why didn't I just schedule some of this in advance?" kind. 

That's when Buffer waltzed into our lives. Not with a fanfare but maybe a subtle jazz tune, because honestly, BUFFER IS COOL. This tool became the ringmaster of our chaotic social media circus, and our sanity thanked us. 

## Stepping Back: What is Buffer Anyway?

Before we dive deep, let’s step back for those who might be wondering—what in the world is Buffer? It's a nifty tool that lets us schedule posts across various social media platforms. It's like a digital assistant that works 24/7. We just tell it when and what to post, and voila! It's out there preaching on our behalf even when we might be busy trouncing deadlines or mystery inhaling our breakfast.

## The Day We Realized Buffer Could Be Our Bestie

On this one completely wild Tuesday, we decided to test Buffer seriously. Think of this as our leap of faith—nay, a swan dive—into optimizing the social advertising strategy pool. The first thing we did was evaluate how to use Buffer’s scheduling features effectively. We huddled in my small home office, papers scattering everywhere like a strategic tornado, and got to work.

### Getting Started with Buffer

First things first, if you haven't signed up for Buffer—do it! Visit the [Buffer website](https://buffer.com) and create your account. It’s like signing up for a marathon, but way more fun and significantly less foot blisters.

### Connecting Social Accounts

Visualize this part like playing social media matchmaker. Connecting your accounts to Buffer is simple. Once logged in:

1. Click 'Connect Social Accounts.'
2. Pick the platform of your choice—Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
3. Follow the prompts to authorize Buffer to post on your behalf. You won't have to remember umpteen passwords anymore. Freedom feels good, huh?

### Crafting the Perfect Post

Fast forward to a lazy Sunday afternoon when I decided to cue up my creative brain cells and tap out a few posts. Here’s the trick: Create a backlog of posts. When creativity flows, it flows.

- #### Create a New Post

     On Buffer’s dashboard:
     - Click on 'Queue' to open up your scheduling space.
     - Write your post.
     - Add images, links, hashtags—dress it up like it’s going to prom.

- #### Best Times to Post

     Relinquish control to Buffer’s brilliant algorithm. Allow it to fetch the best times your audience is alive and eager for some new content.

### Scheduling Like a Pro

On the granular Friday night we fully committed, we started scheduling posts. It felt almost ceremonious—a moment akin to placing chess pieces on the board with the thrill of an impending checkmate. 

- #### Choose Your Day and Time

     After writing a post:
     - Click on 'Schedule Post.'
     - Select date and time. Remember, this is the magic part. You decide and Buffer implements—no magic carpet needed.

- #### Set Regular Times

     If you fancy a more routine approach, use Buffer’s 'Posting Schedule' to set predefined times for your posts to go live. You can laden multiple days, each with varying vibes.

### Managing and Monitoring Posts

A couple of weeks in, our previous chaos had transformed. It felt like an epiphany—or the feeling you get when you find fries at the bottom of the bag. Delightful! Here's what we did to continue optimizing and ensuring our strategy matched world-class shine.

- #### Tweak and Tinker

     Posts aren’t final. They’re living entities. Edit them if they seem wildly out of place—or if your latest insight screams for a change. Head to 'Queue,' click 'Edit' next to the post, and make the necessary tweaks.

- #### Analytics – Because Data is Our Frenemy

     Buffer’s analytics felt like enlightenment in numbers. It helps us see how well our posts performed. Click on 'Analytics,' and venture into the ecosystem of charts and numbers—which sounds ultra-geeky but it's what helps us grow.

## Buffer Isn’t Just a Tool; It’s A Team Member

Our schedule gradually started resembling the beautifully orchestrated routine of lifelong friends working in harmony rather than cats randomly knocking over vases. It taught us to delve deeper into strategy rather than scramble over daily social media hassles.

So, we began aligning our adverts in Buffer particularly suited to our audience’s likes and dislikes, all while sipping coffee that wasn’t cold anymore. Achieving this perfect blend of creativity guided by data, we could finally nurture our brand message, just as we would a thriving, exotic garden.

## In the End, the Journey is Circular

From that chaotic morning to our now serene—or at least organized—social media strategy, the transformation was heartening. Buffer’s scheduling didn’t just tweak our timetable. It fundamentally improved how we approached our social content, proving that even routine tools can become pivotal partners in our pursuit of a smart advertising strategy.

May all our adventures with technology be slightly less chaotic—and may our coffee always be warm.
