# Using BuzzSumo for Link Building Strategies

---

Years ago, on a rainy Tuesday in October when the leaves dared not stay on the trees and preferred tumbling down to the sidewalks, I first stumbled upon BuzzSumo, an odd-sounding yet vibrant cog in the wheel of digital marketing. During a late-night brainstorming session—really just an excuse for us to drink too much coffee and order just one more pizza—I clicked on BuzzSumo, expecting the cosmos to reveal some secret marketing treasure. And folks, did it ever. Two more pizzas and several cups of coffee later, we had a strategy. A strategy that I'd now like to share with you, our imaginary readers and friends. 

## A Discovery in Digital Wilderness

Those early days—crammed in a room adorned with vintage motivational posters and an alarming amount of sticky notes—were full of trial and error. We knew almost nothing and that was thrilling. It was like trying to find the cabin in the woods where the secret party was happening, without directions but with a vague hint that it might involve BuzzSumo.

BuzzSumo didn't just offer us insights. It became our compass. For those of you who haven't yet discovered it, BuzzSumo is essentially a content research tool that unlocks the doors to what's trending, what's sharing, and what's working for everyone else. In essence, BuzzSumo became our spyglass in the world of link-building. 

### Getting Started with BuzzSumo

**1. The Opening Clicks:**

Begin by going to [BuzzSumo’s website](https://buzzsumo.com/). Personally, I find the sign-up process refreshingly straightforward, like greeting an old friend at the airport. You'll need to create an account which, in our shared caffeine haze back then, somehow felt like a rite of passage.

**2. Choosing the Right Subscription:**

BuzzSumo offers various plans. Start with a trial to get your feet wet, but if you're anything like us, soon you’ll find yourself diving headfirst into one of their comprehensive plans. It might feel like purchasing a theme park pass, thrilling with a hint of financial caution.

**3. Time to Explore:**

Once in, the search bar is your new best friend. We typed every keyword we could think of, like kids raiding a candy store. Type in a topic relevant to your niche that tickles your professional fancy. BuzzSumo sorts through its vast digital library and presents you with the most shared pieces of related content across social media platforms. 

### The Magic of Discovery: The Art of Content Research

On rainy afternoons, when our brains needed a break from the glow of data analytics flickering on the screen, we used BuzzSumo’s “Content Analyzer” tool. Ah, content analyzer—our beacon of light on foggy marketing waters. 

**Topic Discovery:**

Have a cup of tea ready for this adventure—you'll need it. By inputting a broad topic, BuzzSumo will unfold a treasure map of related content that’s performing incredibly well, showing shares, likes, and all those sweet data points you can’t wait to pop into a spreadsheet.

**Play with Filters:**

This is where it gets fun. Filter results by date, country, language, or content type and watch as BuzzSumo bends at your whim. We treated it like a game—imagine playing digital chess against millions of content creators. It was our secret weapon.

### The Strategy of Empires: Building with Backlinks

Building links with BuzzSumo felt akin to constructing Lego skyscrapers with unlimited bricks.

**1. Backlink Opportunities:**

Enter the term of your choice—perhaps “dancing llamas,” why not? Use the *Content Analyzer* to locate top articles in your niche. But stay focused on those pieces with significant shares and backlinks. This is like finding the cool kid at school—everyone wants to hang out with them. 

**2. Copy Their Homework:**

Well, not directly. We're talking about making strategic partnerships. By studying content with high backlinks, we can reach out to those linking domains, offering our insightful, high-caliber content that rivals or complements what's already there. It's about being part of the conversation, right?

**3. Author Alert:**

BuzzSumo allows you to set up alerts for specific authors or keywords. It’s sort of like creating a digital pen-pal scenario, where you are always just slightly ahead in knowing what your favorite authors are up to. We used it to shamelessly spot opportunities for collaboration or inspiration.

### Creating Shareable Content: The Gold Standard

While BuzzSumo helps us find what works, weaving our own digital magic to create something people would clamor to link to was the end goal.

**Content Types:**

Use BuzzSumo to analyze the type of content that garners the most attention in your sector—it could be infographics, listicles, how-tos (aren't we meta right now?), videos, etc. Tailor your content based on these findings—a little statistical alchemy to elevate your digital presence.

**Look at the Competition:**

We peeked at competitors’ popular pieces, sometimes with a mix of awe and envy. Why not emulate and enhance what's already out there? The digital world could always use a new twist on an old tale.

**Outreach:**

Once our stellar content sparkled, we used BuzzSumo again to locate influencers—those shining stars in the digital firmament who might help us with shares or backlinks. We knew that forming relationships with influencers transitions you from a lonely star in the digital sky to a constellation of connected brilliance. 

### Finding and Fostering Collaborations

Back during our sticky-note-fueled strategy sessions, we realized link-building ain't just about the links. It's about fostering genuine digital camaraderie. 

**Finding Influencers:**

BuzzSumo’s *Influencers’ feature* felt like attending a reunion where you know you’ll bump into old friends. We used it to identify key influencers to collaborate with or learn from.

**The Perfect Pitch:**

Armed with our query results, we crafted personalized pitches. We’re talking about calls to action so enticing, they could sell ice to penguins. Building relationships was crucial. These weren’t just tactical alliances; they were communities of supportive professionals in a highly competitive world.

### The Path Forward: Growth and Reflection

BuzzSumo taught us—and still teaches us—that the world of digital marketing is ever-evolving. Every click, keyword, and connection building towards an undefined future, filled with potential and adventure. We’ve only touched a small part of what it offers.

Back in that room with our paper cups and soggy napkins full of ideas, using BuzzSumo was like harnessing a wild wind into sails, propelling us towards new digital shores. Now, when I think back to that day and those early steps, I feel a deep-seated gratitude for the journey and the camaraderie it brought—the late-night laughs, the meeting of minds over those endless data points, and, yes, the secret love affair with BuzzSumo. 

So, here’s to you, reader, in hopes that you too find the secret party using a tool like BuzzSumo. Hopefully with less caffeine consumption than we did.
