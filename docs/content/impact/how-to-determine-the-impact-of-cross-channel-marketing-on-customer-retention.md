# How to Determine the Impact of Cross Channel Marketing on Customer Retention

Have you ever been enchanted by a story that unexpectedly stitches every part of your being with a singular thread of curiosity? I found myself in this peculiar tide, not by a grand epiphany, but more of an insight stumbled upon while waiting for freshly brewed coffee at Mary's corner café. You see, Mary, with her piercing eyes and big-hearted laughter, runs this tiny shop, and quite uniquely, remains oddly resistant to any digital allure—insisting instead on the charm of old-style, word-of-mouth promotions. One Tuesday morning, I observed something captivating while sitting by the counter. Several patrons had come not just for coffee but the warmth Mary exuded, having been drawn in previously by flyers at local fairs and equally charmed by her radio jingle. And then it dawned on me: Mary's true genius wasn't just her best-selling batch brew but her innate knack for cross channel interaction, manifesting beautifully as customer retention. With Mary in mind, let's embark on a journey unraveling how businesses—big or small—can retain that magical draw using cross channel marketing.

### Step 1: Setting the Compass - Identifying Our Channels

Before we wade into the waters of analysis, picture this: Mary finds herself brainstorming marketing tactics with her nephew, Tim, whose head brims with digital marketing jargon. He proposes a mix of social media, direct mails, in-store events, and email marketing. A cross channel marketing strategy begins by identifying potential touchpoints. Think about the platforms where you'd want your audience to find you. Is it there on Twitter where brevity is golden, or perhaps via personalized emails that whisper louder than a billboard? The key is alignment. We need our channels to echo a consistent message—a chorus, not a cacophony. So, what will be your channel symphony?

### Step 2: Collecting the Puzzle Pieces - Gathering Data

We spent countless coffee dates at Mary's trying to muster enthusiasm for numbers, draping it with the allure of a treasure hunt. Out of this, emerged an appreciation for data collection—an art of gathering customer information from these different channels. Tim set up a simple CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system—like a shoebox organizer but for data. Whether customers interacted through her newsletter, RSVP’d for events, or chatted on social media, every piece became part of a puzzle mapping the customer journey. It’s important to have centralized access to data, a place where the nuggets are collected effortlessly.

### Step 3: Behind the Curtain - Measuring Engagement Across Channels

Here, Tim introduced Mary to the wonder of KPIs—Key Performance Indicators—a bit like stories our customers tell us through metrics. Engagement rates, click-through rates, or what we laughingly dubbed the window-shopping effect. For instance, Mary could have hundreds of likes on a new product post on Instagram, but only a few would trickle down to window shoppers actually stepping into her café. We must measure these ripples in the pond. Use analytic tools like Google Analytics or Facebook Insights to see how customers are interacting across channels. It's not just about counting beans, but understanding them.

### Step 4: Decoding the Riddle - Analyzing Patterns

This is where our inner detective gets a chance to shine. By putting on our metaphorical deerstalker hats, like data-driven Sherlocks, we decipher patterns and trends. In Mary’s case, she saw seasonal bursts of social media engagement during local events, which translated to a direct increase in comic sales during footfall spikes post these events. This analysis helps us recognize which combinations of channels hold harmonies that resonate best with audiences. Those same connections are the ones we aim to replicate and enhance.

### Step 5: The Alchemy of Integration - Crafting a Seamless Experience 

Somewhere in the middle of the rain-soaked April—Mary's café saw foot traffic like never before. Her digital nephew had introduced a campaign that wove together email reminders of special roasts tied with social media sneak peeks, converging at a loyalty reward when they visited her shop. The buzzword here was integration—the Madison Avenue way of ensuring each channel connects to the next step in a unified manner. The trick lies in crafting these experiences, where emails bolster social media interactions into tangible in-store experiences or even online reviews. It's all about creating continuity in a way that feels organic.

### Step 6: Giving Wings to Feedback - Staying Adaptive 

On a cloudy Thursday, Mary approved a new blend, inspired from customer feedback vigorously written on suggestion cards—doubtless, plucked from a bygone era when direct feedback felt sacred. However, today, this feedback flows freely through digital channels. Feedback tools like surveys, online reviews, or direct customer interactions ensure that businesses adapt to their customers’ evolving needs. Interpreting this feedback allows adjustments in the strategy, ensuring the cross channel experience remains synchronistic.

### Step 7: Measuring Impact - Retention Analysis 

Finding ourselves back at our familiar counter with a myriad of coffee choices, I couldn't help but ponder about calibrating the impact of our cross-channel marketing on customer retention. Tim used customer lifetime value (CLV) and retention rates as his primary lodestars on this end. After six months into the plan, we saw an increase in repeat visits and word-of-mouth recommendations—lampooned affectionately as "Mary's Magic Broom Effect" (a nod to her consistent knack at sweeping her customers off their feet). By measuring the engagement and retention metrics, we assess whether our cross-channel symphony indeed hits the right note with our choir of customers.

### Conclusion: A New Morning Routine

Reflecting as we sip Mary's latest concoction alongside her hand-rolled scones with the café brimming vibrantly with life—where patrons are no longer just patrons but part of a storytelling ensemble deftly woven together through thoughtful interaction spread across channels. And it is through this shared journey of discoveries and missteps—a deck mix of channels resonating across time and space—that we define and refine the fabric of customer loyalty. The journey of understanding and improving the impact of cross channel marketing requires more than numbers; it requires a heartbeat, a melody unique to each. After all, each new-clad morning holds within its folds countless new stories waiting to be unraveled.
