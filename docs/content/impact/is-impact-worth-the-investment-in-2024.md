# Is Impact Worth the Investment in 2024?

## A Morning on the Lakeside

Last Tuesday morning was like any other, except it wasn't. As I stood beside the lake, the air, crisp as freshly laundered linen, carried a serenading chorus of birds doing whatever it is they do best at that ungodly hour. That's when it hit me—a realization about the value of impact, the kind that creeps up and pokes at you with a stick when you least expect it. We often gloss over the true measure of what impact represents in our ventures, be they business or personal. As I watched the ripples spreading out from a pebble I absent-mindedly tossed into the water, the metaphor wasn't lost on me. The ripple effect, much like the impact of our investments, stretches beyond what the eye can see or the mind can conceive initially. In 2024, is the impact worth our investment, both fiscal and emotional?

## The Currency of Impact

Now to get a tad philosophical here—bear with me—we collectively tend to measure achievements not merely in material gain but in the imprint they leave on others. We’re peculiar creatures that way. Think about it: Steve, my neighbor who spends his weekends volunteering at the local animal shelter, insists that time is his most significant investment. And honestly, his face lights up like a jack-o'-lantern every time he talks about that one golden retriever with separated anxiety—what was its name? Ruffles? The impact, he says, is the payoff, even if it's fluffier than the traditional accountant-approved ledger.

When we translate this into business lingo (because let’s not kid ourselves, that’s where we gravitate), the 'impact' runs tandem with elements like corporate social responsibility, customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty. Companies that invest in impact tend to garner favor not for their bank balances but for their ethos. Picture this, an office where the employees genuinely smile—not because they’ve been forced into a photographic moment for the company brochure, but because the organization fuels them with purpose. In 2024, conscientious or impact-focused capital has become more than a trend; it's part of the business DNA.

## Dollars and Sense

Flashback to the lakeside, and there I was again, pondering about these pebbles of wisdom while Ava—my ever-curious seven-year-old niece—kept skimming flat stones she magically plucked out of nowhere. We got talking—what else do you do when skipping stones? I tried explaining dollars and impact with the astuteness of a part-time philosopher and a full-time nerdy uncle (not always a winning combo). “If you spent a dollar on things that could really help someone rather than just buying candy, would you?” Her eyes glossed over at candy, obviously, but she nodded along gamely because that’s what supportive nieces do.

The financial equivalent of Ava’s conundrum is found in sustainable investments or ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria. Investors, increasingly so, prefer to look beyond profit margins and deep into a company's heart—its impact on the planet and people. Placed under a microscope—or a child’s curious gaze—things like environmentally-friendly initiatives and fair-trade practices appear as appealing as, well, a big jar of candy. And many argue that in the long run, such investments reap higher returns, both tangible and existential.

## Humanizing the Metrics

Among the things I happened upon recently was the splendidly chaotic birthday party for Jeff's two-year-old twins, Max and Susie. There was cake everywhere, confetti in my shoes, and a fleeting thought about how people measure success today. It’s not about how many party streamers you can hang, or whether you outsource party planning to a galaxy far, far away. It's the laughter, the untapped energy, the memories forged amidst miniature pandemonium.

Back in the grown-up world, businesses have started to humanize metrics. Remember Tom from accounting who screams "synergy"? Yeah, him. People like Tom are engaging more with KPIs that reflect genuine wellbeing—employee satisfaction, carbon footprint reduction, social equity. They're learning to prioritize these metrics alongside, or sometimes above, traditional benchmarks of success. People—and by people, I mean us collectively buzzing around like caffeinated bees—value meaningful work and sustainable endeavors. Because just like parties, memories, and moments, what truly resonates cannot merely be quantified in digits and decimals.

## Riding the Impact Wave into 2024

The lake now is a tranquil silhouette of the day—Ava has since exhausted my fellow joggers with endless energy. I muse about riding waves, literal and metaphorical, and what 2024 could hold if we embraced impact like a long-lost friend. We, the ever-evolving society, cling to the belief that impact is the gentle nudge towards forward-thinking societies and businesses. Somewhere between the frothy cappuccinos and tech meet-ups, this realization bubbles—the wave of impact is both inspiring and inevitable.

The deeper question remains: Is impact worth the investment? To answer, whisper to the inner idealists within us—those who dream big and act even bigger. We may ourselves become the ripple, sparkling in some grand, ever-expanding lake. As we stride into 2024, the best way forward seems to be an investment in what truly matters—people, the planet, and purpose. After all, when we invest in impact, we have the power to craft a legacy, brimful of meaning, capable of resonating far beyond our temporal reaches and societal constraints.

In closing—half apology, half invitation—I have no definitive template or 'how-to' cheat sheet here. It’s just us, a pebble, a ripple, and a dream that refuses to sink. It’s choosing the Ruffles of the world over the spreadsheet. A joyful investment, indeed.
