# How to Use Evernote with GTD Getting Things Done Methodology

---

### A Prologue: Chaos to Clarity

Years ago, in a galaxy not so far away, I found myself surrounded by a desk that was more paper mountain than work surface. It’s like I was living in a particularly uninspired Dilbert cartoon. There were sticky notes with their vintage year of creation unknown, a notebook with cryptic scribblings - possibly in Elvish, and a tower of unfiled documents that could rival Pisa. One fine Thursday, possibly under the calming spell of a morning tea, I thought, "There must be a better way." Enter: Evernote with the GTD methodology.

It wasn't just about taming the chaos into submission—oh no—it was about creating a harmonious ecosystem of thoughts and tasks. It was about turning that paper Everest into a nimble, almost acrobatic, dance of productivity. So, as we explore this digital odyssey, let’s dive into how Evernote and GTD became the peanut butter and jelly of my organizational sandwich.

### The Adventure Begins: Capturing

Picture us: bright-eyed and probably panicking - at the disco or otherwise - embarking on a grand journey, with Evernote as our trusty backpack. The first rule of GTD, which we embrace like a new pet hamster, is to capture everything. We mean everything. Every brilliant idea that strikes out of the blue, and even that reminder that milk *always* finds a way to run out mid-cereal bowl.

**Step 1: Create a Notebook for Capturing**

In Evernote, creating a notebook is akin to crafting a digital haven. Go to your Evernote dashboard. Once there, press the '+' symbol to create a new notebook and label it "Inbox." This is where the magic starts. Here, it’s not just about clarity. It’s about liberation—those wild, unfiltered thoughts and commitments making their triumphant escape from the mental clutter.

**Step 2: Organize Your Chaos**

Think of each note as a tiny parcel of potential, waiting to be opened. Every digital scrap you jot down needs a home in your Inbox. Use Evernote's versatile tools—like snapping a quick photo of that mysterious sticky note or transcribing your avalanche of thoughts into the digital realm.

Throwing in a little tech wizardry, you can use the Evernote Web Clipper for those moments when procrastination takes you to the darkest recesses of online cat videos yet reminds you of a forgotten idea. Click and clip—it’s saved to your growing first step stash.

### Processing the Madness: Clarification

Once the flurry of capture flickers to a still, we must channel one of life's hardest truths: not everything warrants the time of day. Processing them is like curating a museum—one suited to reflect your mental musings and aspirations.

**Step 3: Emptying the Inbox (Sans Existential Dread)**

Set aside regular intervals—a suggestion: perhaps Sundays with a strong brew or Fridays using caffeine as your spirit guide—to process that monstrous heap. Each item requires a decision. Procrastinators beware, it’s time for honesty.

Is it actionable or just wishful thinking? If actionable and under two minutes—conquer it. Like eating your vegetable equivalent tasks—get them done. If it’ll take longer, set it aside for more thought or add to your 'next action' list.

**Step 4: Organizing into Categories**

Create strategic notebooks or notebook stacks such as "Next Actions," "Projects," and "Someday/Maybe." Move each processed gem from the Inbox here. Recall, this is about engaging with what matters, reflecting our evolving narratives.

### Juggling Life's Circus: Implementation

It's time to bring the ideas alive, where they can blossom, just like those sunflowers I once tried growing. While Evernote does most of the heavy lifting, syncing our endeavors across digital landscapes, personal commitment remains our driving force.

**Step 5: Setting Context with Tags**

Tags in Evernote are the trusty Swiss army knife of organization. Assign tags such as "errand," "computer," or "phone" to denote where the task can be executed. This means no more thinking, just click and complete – bare minimum mental commitment when the day ends with brains the texture of mashed potatoes.

**Step 6: The Weekly Review**

Ah, the legendary weekly review. Like clearing an enchanted forest, it refines perspectives and charts our course. Schedule this like a chat with an old friend. Review each project, task list, and your inbox, adjusting priorities and reclaiming aspirations that may have slipped through the cracks. Updating Evernote becomes oddly satisfying—like watching inbox zero become hero.

### Reflecting upon Horizons: Engagement

As we journey onward, tasks are not just abandoned toys. They become part of a grander dialogue with our dreams and desires—a mirror to our intentions.

**Step 7: Trusting the Process**

As whimsical as life’s dance can be, trusting the GTD process and Evernote’s stalwart presence gives us confidence. It clears space for serendipity, that spontaneous coffee break that turns into a brainstorm, with not a single sticky note in sight. It’s progress, delightful and profound.

### The Denouement: Our Organized Life

So, here we are, dear reader, on the other side of chaos. Our desk, unrecognizable from its past life, is now the epitome of digital feng shui. Shared among us is a journey of transformation—one of thoughtful captures, confident executions, and a trusty companion in Evernote.

The metamorphosis from orderless jumble to structured brilliance isn't merely productivity—it’s storytelling at its finest. Together, we embraced Evernote and GTD, not merely to clear space but to pave avenues for creativity and accomplishment. If you dove, if you dreamt, then this is your story too. Til our next adventure, go forth—to capture, process, organize, and most importantly, live.
