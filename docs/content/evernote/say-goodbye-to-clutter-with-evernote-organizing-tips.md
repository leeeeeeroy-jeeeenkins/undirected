# Say Goodbye to Clutter with Evernote Organizing Tips

Last Tuesday, I found myself drowning—not literally—I wasn’t submerged in actual water, though it might as well have been. It was paper. Piles and piles of it. Receipts from 2019, grocery lists scribbled on napkins, and three versions of a draft letter to the HOA. My tags for things were “things I might need, things I probably won’t, but keeping just in case.” It was all a bit much, and not in the delightful, whimsical way you'd expect. That’s when I remembered the dusty icon of Evernote parked quietly on my phone home screen.

We've all been there, haven't we? In that unruly clutter kingdom where chaos reigns and intentions to organize remain just that—intentions. Yet here comes Evernote, our porcelain knight, wielding the sword of digital tidiness. It’s more than just notes, my friends. It's a lifestyle choice, and once you make that choice, you won’t go back. Or so I hoped.

## The Beginner’s Note-ography: Capturing the Chaos

In came our rookie revelation: open one blank note. We started with something basic, meandering through the interface like baby ducks learning to swim—wobbly and unsure, but optimistic. Tap “New Note,” I whispered, as if the tech gremlins would hear and take it away. We began a new document—aptly titled "For Later Review"—and dropped in everything we could fit. Photos, links, lists; it was like the Island of Misfit Toys, but with digital knick-knacks.

Here's the drill for capturing that chaos: 

1. **Create a New Note**: Tap or click the “+” and name it something catchy, but not provocative. I've tried using names like “The Cave of Wonders,” but never again.
   
2. **Add Everything and the Kitchen Sink**: Toss in images from your camera roll, and if you're feeling fancy, attach PDFs or audio notes.

3. **Make Annotations**: Use the text and drawing tools to jot memories or highlight, but don’t be excessive or you might send yourself love letters in the highlights for years to come.

4. **Save and Sync**: Sync often—like your life depends on it. We live in fear of data goblins that come when least expected, so it’s a good habit.

Remember when Meg from accounting found that mind-bending spreadsheet among her grandmother’s love letters? She probably didn’t use Evernote. The takeaway here: baby-steps into the digital declutter space make a gigantic difference.

## Notebooks: The Digital Filing Cabinet

Picture little compartments where you can categorize the contents of your brain. Notebooks. Digital serenity.

After capturing the chaos with a single note, our next Eureka moment was when we realized that not tất cả the eggs belong in one metaphorical basket. I whispered to myself—because loud noises disrupt creativity—they have notebooks. Cue the triumphant soundtrack from “Chariots of Fire,” and in we dove. 

### Let's Get Organized:

1. **Create Your Notebooks**: Click “New Notebook,” decide on something better than I did — “Stuff” was not my best work. Opt for categories like “Work” or “Personal,” relatable things of that nature.

2. **Categorize and Drag**: Drag your outlier notes into their respective homes. My “Honey It’s Thursday” playlist notes ended up next to shopping lists and wise words from Dr. Seuss—perhaps intentional, perhaps not.

3. **Shared Notebooks**: Need to share? Team projects have never been easier. Move it to the shared universe. Add your people - make sure you trust them, or document your secrets in Klingon.

4. **Tags Galore**: Don’t forget about tags! They’re the butter to Evernote's bread. Make it fun. I tag holiday trips “Wish You Were Here,” sprinkled with irony.

When I shared these tips with Grandpa Joe, he mused, “More organized than my old filing cabinet of taxes '86-'95.” I took it as the highest compliment.

## Tasks & Checklists: Wrangle the To-Dos

Taming the chaotic beast of our to-dos has been a lifelong quest. Armored with Evernote’s spiffy task feature, we became our own organizational overlords. Remember that plum genius who invented bubble wrap? Imagine doing the same for your tasks. 

### How We Tamed Our To-Do Lists:

1. **Use Checklists**: Within a note, click on the little checklist icon. Start with small potatoes—“order new coffee beans,” not “build rocket.”

2. **Deadlines and Reminders**: Life isn’t a jazz concert; timing does matter. Set deadlines and turn on reminders with precision otherwise reserved for baking soufflés.

3. **Prioritize with Tags**: Use creative tags like “this week,” “someday”, or my favorite, “yesterday”—still needs doing, but better late than never.

4. **Task Templates**: Create schnazzy task templates. Me? I love listing everything from grocery lists to packing guides. Templates make it all feel quite official.

The clarity in keeping tasks in Evernote rather than random sticky notes on the fridge—it’s akin to finally separating the M&Ms by color.

## Integrate with Third-party Tools: Modern Day Mythical Creature Handling

Our final boss fight involves integrating our newfound digital paradise with other work and life apps. Trello, Slack, Google Calendar, whatever floats your productivity boat. Evernote plays nice here, like a cooperative animal mascot.

### Integration Dance Best Practices:

1. **Link Dropbox or Drive**: Pull in pertinent docs or images—everything keeps the same access across platforms. No more hunting elusive documents.

2. **Sync with Calendar**: Let the seas of scheduling bring dolphins instead of storms. Integrate with Google Calendar for tasks that never slip through cracks.

3. **Connect Email**: Forward important emails pageant-style into Evernote. Unsupported emails like “how to survive Thursday” stay in the email abyss—but the good ones make the leap.

4. **Zapier Magic**: Evernote can do imaginative things with Zapier. Streamline it by syncing apps your heart never knew it needed harmonizing with.

Helen from procurement says she’s so integrated with Evernote, she found herself trying to clip her cat videos. If that’s not a testament to the system's reach, what is?

And there you have it. From messy rats' nest to orderly woodpecker lair, we bid adieu to clutter. Those papers no longer lording their power over our desks and lives. With Evernote, we’ve transformed from sheet stragglers into note navigators, like Magellan—but with WiFi. 

So, my friends, grab that digital sword confidently, and may we slay our clutter dragons with joyous abandon—one synchronized note at a time.
