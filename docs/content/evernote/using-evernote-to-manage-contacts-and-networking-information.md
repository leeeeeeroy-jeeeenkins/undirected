# Using Evernote to Manage Contacts and Networking Information

## The Coffee Shop Epiphany

Ah, the smell of roasted beans and the cozy chatter of a morning coffee shop. It was a day like any other when we realized our contact list was a chaotic mess—think of our phone contacts, scribbled business cards lying forgotten, and emails buried in an abyss at the bottom of the inbox. We'd missed following up on a couple of promising leads and frankly, the stabbing pang of guilt began surfacing every time a new networking opportunity dawned. A casual mention from our friend Amy, always the organized one, about how she tamed her networking madness with Evernote was the spark we needed. She said, “Evernote is like that digital junk drawer that organizes itself.” Skeptical? Oh, absolutely. Intrigued? More than a turkey at Thanksgiving. 

## Setting the Stage: Our Journey Begins

So, we embarked on this Evernote exploration together. Armed with nothing more than our trusty laptops and curiosity, the task: reclaim the sanity of our contact management. First step, installation. Simple—or it should have been. We realized later that Amy probably giggled when we struggled with the download. But, after a few - okay many - attempts and morsels of patience, we had it. Our digital companion was ready to serve, perched at the edge of our screens eagerly awaiting its marching orders.

Once you've managed to install Evernote (bravo on not throwing your laptop out the window), the real fun begins. Here's the roadmap we crafted in our thirsty drive for order:

### Creating a Notebook: The Digital Filing Cabinet

We affectionately named ours “The Human Directory.” It was time to bid adieu to scattered information. Go into Evernote, click on `New Notebook`, and voila, our collection of names had a home.

Here’s a little inside story. We hesitated at the naming part; typical perfectionism, right? We suggest something memorable, trust us, it helps when trying to find it amidst other gems in your digital stash. Also, spoiler: you **can** rename it later.

### Digital Clipping: Saving Contacts

Starting with the basics, adding contacts became as easy as saving an online cookie recipe. We opened Evernote and started our new note with each contact’s name. From there, we filled in pertinent info—email, phone number, how we met (which is super helpful once we meet five Peters from different networking events), and any shared interests.

Diving into details felt like weaving little narratives - “Met Tom at that surreal underwater conference - great love for sharks and tea." Imagining future conversations made this task never feel like a mundane chore, but rather a way of conniving serendipity into our lives. 

### Tags: The Magic Wands

At some point, you gotta hunt down a needle from the haystack of contacts and that’s when tagging becomes your superhero tool. We categorized folks with tags like “Tech-Gurus”, “Booklovers”, or “Email-When-Desperate.” Each tag was like a mini mental chuckle fitting of its assigned group.

1. Click the `Add Tag` option.
2. Type in the chosen tag. See? Easy-peasy.

Amy had once laughed over a cold brew, “Someday, you’ll thank me for tagging.” We won’t admit she was right, but she definitely possessed psychic foresight. 

## Keeping Contacts Alive

Now that your contacts have life within that organized notebook of yours, maintenance becomes key. Here comes another leap of faith—setting a reminder. It’s not as terrifying as it sounds, honestly. 

### Reminders: The Gentle Nudge

Evernote can set reminders so that you remember to check in with your contacts. Here’s how we did it:

1. Open a note you want to create a reminder for.
2. Click `Reminder` at the top.
3. Set a date, and done!

Remember when Aunt Susan always reminded you to bring a sweater during family picnics? Just like that, minus the sweater.

### Scan Business Cards: The Digital Swindle

If you’re constantly losing business cards - guilty as charged - Evernote has got a scanner feature. Capture cards right into Evernote using the mobile app.

Many were our times when hastily stuffed cards were rediscovered after a traumatic laundry session. This feature was the holy grail we didn’t know we needed.

## Sharing and Synching: Welcome to the Cloud Era

The best part about Evernote? Everything synchs faster than your impulse to binge-watch a new Netflix series. That’s right. Evernote embraces the cloud, which means:

- **Access anywhere:** Be it at home, office, or hey - the local café where Gossip Jerry lurks.
- **Share with colleagues:** Need to share the details of that elusive graphic designer with your project team? Easy sharing ensures everyone’s on the same page.

Evernote gives you that feeling of accomplishment, similar to when you finally fit all the pieces of a stubborn jigsaw puzzle together—thanks, sense of completion, for making your grand, predictable entrance.

## Treasure Trove of Notes: The Undiscovered Secrets

We discovered that beyond mere contact management, Evernote could morph into our networking event planner. We jotted down notes about upcoming events, prepped on who would be attending, and prepared talking points. Forget Watson; this digital Sherlock hugged all details close and delivered them with the unwavering fortitude of an eager hound.

### Custom Templates: A Personalized Touch

Another revelation, templates make us feel like *organizational artists*. By creating custom templates, we saved ourselves from repeatedly typing base information—loved the efficiency.

To create a template:
1. Create a note with all standard fields.
2. Save it as a template via the ‘Save as Template’ option. Voila—ready to be recycled endlessly.

## Conclusion: Evernote, Our Steadfast Confidant

Our journey with Evernote was met with trials, trivial triumphs, and mini magic moments. From chaos to an organized contact list, our networking game changed forever. So, what began in a coffee shop, over nervous chatter and hopeful glances shared with Amy, led to a surprising source of order and connectivity. Evernote played guardian angel over our relationships and taught us that organizing contacts isn’t just about having data, it's about remembering the stories that connect us to those names and numbers.

We invite you, dear reader, to join us on this journey of digital tidiness. Go laugh in the face of chaos and make contact management a delightful experience. After all, Evernote is truly our organizing wizard, and, perhaps one day, yours too. Embrace it.
