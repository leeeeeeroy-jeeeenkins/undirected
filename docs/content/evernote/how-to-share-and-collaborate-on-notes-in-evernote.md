# How to Share and Collaborate on Notes in Evernote

---

Have you ever settled into a sun-dappled corner of your favorite coffee shop, eyelids slightly sticky from the siren call of caffeine, and opened up Evernote with every intention of finally organizing your digital disarray? You know the feeling, a sense of purpose brewed alongside your espresso. It’s akin to tidying a workshop where every tool holds a story, every scribble an idea just waiting to connect the dots.

For us, this particular episode of note-sharing enlightenment began when my friend Maya—a perpetual cross-country wanderer with an admirably chaotic approach to life akin to a Wes Anderson movie—sent me a quaint message: "Help! Need to merge genius brainstorms on Globetrotter's Guidebook & thinking Evernote." Thus sparked a journey on how we could both meticulously and effortlessly share our genius—or haphazard musings—without sacrificing our sanity to a digital black hole.

Let’s embark on this expedition together, shall we?

## Setting Up Evernote for Collaborative Bliss

In the beginning, there was a whirlwind of creativity. Maya and I first needed to assess our Evernote settings—kind of like deciding who brings the marshmallows and who brings the graham crackers before a camping trip. Collaboration, after all, is a delicate balance of preemptive understanding.

### Step 1: Choosing the Right Plan

First things first. Evernote provides various services (Basic, Premium, Business), each akin to choosing the comfy seating at a cinema. We opted for Evernote Premium—it offered more storage space and nifty features like offline access. Maya, with her notorious habit of disappearing into the wild where Wi-Fi feared to tread, needed that offline capability like a duck needs water.

### Step 2: Organize Your Notes

Before jumping into the sharing pool, organizing our notes felt like arranging tunes in a mixtape—we wanted our ideas to flow, to resonate. We created notebooks: one for each chapter of our project, and then populated them with notes resembling swirls of colorful thought-spaghetti.

Do you recall the sudden realization that maybe, just maybe, we were finally adulting the right way? With everything in place, sharing felt almost intuitive, like handing a mix CD to a friend and knowing they’d totally get it.

## Sharing Notes: A Trust Exercise

As we tiptoed onto the icefield of sharing, there was excitement. There was fear—akin to double-daring each other to eat mystery jellybeans. But within Evernote, sharing was really more like awarding someone with a golden ticket into our organized chaos.

### Step 3: Inviting Collaborators

The excitement of inviting others to our land of ideas was a pure delight. Within a note, we clicked on the ‘Share’ button and typed in their emails as easily as making a grocery list. Each collaborator was like an artisan weaving their unique pattern into our creative tapestry.

### Step 4: Setting Permissions

Here, our fingers hesitated, hovering above options—can edit, can view. This was the Evernote version of "Do you trust them with the precious?" Maya likened it to letting someone else have control over the DJ playlist—and we both hated techno.

Remember that time when Maya accidentally deleted a paragraph that had taken me eons to perfect? We laughed it off in the grand scheme of cosmic jokes. With every storm came a rainbow, and like seasoned travelers, we adapted.

## Working Together, Apart

Ah, the art of collaboration—such a fancy word for “how not to step on each other’s toes while building the Eiffel Tower using toothpicks.”

### Step 5: Comments and Discussions

We discovered the delightful addition of comments, a shower of insight raindrops upon the parched desert of singular thinking. To leave a comment, the simple act of right-clicking on text was like whispering secrets across a crowded room. Each comment a nod, or a nudge, in the right direction—or a mischievous sidestep.

### Step 6: Syncing and Organizing

Maya’s penchant for disappearing into mountains meant our notes sometimes needed syncing—a process as soothing and essential as a hot mug of chai on a rainy day. Evernote’s autosave was our unsung hero, ensuring our ideas didn’t evaporate like mist.

These constellations of interconnected scribbles became the backbone of our project, blossoming into something we could genuinely be proud of. It was as though the universe conspired to nudge our frayed creativity back to coherence.

## Harmonizing the Note Symphony

Like an orchestra, our final symphony of notes came together with both grace and a touch of chaos, echoing harmonies composed from the discordant sounds of trial and error, and sometimes, accidental genius.

### Step 7: Reviewing and Finalizing

Our project now felt like it had sprouted wings, ready to soar. Reviewing became less about finding fault and more about ensuring every note was like a feather in perfect alignment. Here's a fun tip: read your notes aloud—it adds color and texture you didn’t know existed. We laughed at our typos and celebrated our turns of phrases with the kind of joy saved for fireworks on New Year’s Eve.

### Step 8: Exporting and Sharing

Finally, with the project polished like a sea-glass gem, we exported our notes as a PDF—a process almost too simple, as if presenting the world with a neatly wrapped gift. Reina, another friend, told me she imagined it like sending a message in a bottle.

In the end, our adventure in sharing and collaboration with Evernote felt like a well-told story, full of twists, unexpected allies, and a satisfyingly sweet ending. It was about forging a connection across miles and ideas, a delicate dance with many leads.

It's your turn now—to wield Evernote with a bit of creative courage and a twist of daring. Go on, share your note symphony. The stage is all yours, my friend.
