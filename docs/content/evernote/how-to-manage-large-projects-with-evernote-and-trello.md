# How to Manage Large Projects with Evernote and Trello

When we first embarked on the herculean task of organizing our community theater's annual production, we had enthusiasm and creativity but lacked a rock-solid plan. There was a cast of dozens, each with their own quirks, the need for meticulous choreography, sets that rivaled Broadway, and of course, the ticking clock. Enter Evernote and Trello, which, let me assure you right off the bat, were not just tools—they were lifelines.

### Demystifying the Chaos: Evernote as Our Digital Brain

That Thursday afternoon coffee meeting—where we were practically drowning in scattered papers and caffeine-induced jitters—was the eureka moment. We realized Evernote could be our digital brain! No more shredded sandwiches of sticky notes.

**Step 1:** **Setting Up Notebooks and Notes**

We created a series of notebooks for each major aspect of the production: 'Casting', 'Rehearsals', 'Set Design', 'Costumes', 'Marketing', and my personal favorite, 'Food' (the unsung hero of any event). Each notebook housed notes with scripts, design sketches, and marketing plans. Ah! The sweet symphony of seeing all our plans in one place, like the maestro’s magic wand turned wild notes into a harmonious symphony.

**Step 2:** **Tagging for Easy Retrieval**

Let me tell you, as we tagged each note—from “urgent” to “brainstorm” sessions—it felt like organizing a library where each book landed exactly where it should be, making retrieval so much easier. The tags meant no more late-night convocations face down in a sea of papers for that one piece of information.

**Step 3:** **Utilizing Evernote’s Web Clipper**

We also became internet magpies, using Evernote’s Web Clipper to save inspirational content from around the web. Costume design ideas would flit by faster than our penchant for snacks. A click, a clip, and voilá—conveniently stored for later pondering.

### Painting a Broad Canvas: Trello's Kanban Board

Gary, our director, often emphasized, "The play's blueprint lies in its actions." He wasn’t just talking about actors. As Evernote captured the essence of our plans, Trello was where those plans drew breath, where each task had its own pulse, and quite honestly, made us feel like wizards ordering spells from our digital cauldrons.

**Step 4:** **Creating Boards and Lists**

With Trello, we created a ‘Play Production’ board. Picture this: across it stretched columns for 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Review', and 'Complete'. We set up lists within 'To Do' for individual departments. It was like setting the stage each night knowing where every piece of scenery belonged.

**Step 5:** **Inputting and Moving Cards**

Cards became the components of our daily scripts. From set design deadlines to costume fittings, every task was encapsulated in a card, diligently dragged across columns as the task progressed. It was like watching a digital tapestry weave itself into a masterpiece.

**Step 6:** **Power-Up: Calendar and Automation**

This step deserves a bow. We added the Calendar Power-Up, morphing our Trello board into a bird’s-eye view of the production timeline. We synced deadlines with reality, automating due-date notifications—lest someone forget the grand unveiling or hardcore blunder through rehearsal.

### The Colossus of Taskmastery: Harmonization

For us, the magic was not just in using Evernote or Trello individually but in weaving them together—a dual-system synergy dance! It was like an intricate pas de deux where Appalachian Spring met the abstract cacophony of modern dance.

**Step 7:** **Linking Evernote Notes in Trello**

To integrate, we attached Evernote notes to specific Trello cards. Imagine an exquisite piece of crème brûlée: a Trello card cracked open to reveal the sweet Evernote undertones; a symphony of task and resource that streamlined—not just work, but euphoria.

**Step 8:** **Utilizing Templates and Checklists**

The footsteps followed a certain rhythm: we created templates for recurring tasks in Trello, and each card had sub-tasks detailed in checklists. Think—assembling a set design is much like piecing together a complex puzzle: each section needed instructions, and we relished in checking off each step.

### A Curtain Call: Reflecting on Our Shared Journey

Days turned to nights, stress translated into triumph, and as that curtain fell to a standing ovation, it was more than a play's end. The journey was the production. It was the collaborative hubbub—our shared digital ecosystem through Evernote and Trello—turning potential chaos into an opera of order and art, one note and one card at a time.

Remember this: within those digital scrolls are the memories of our shared hopes, fumbled line readings, and the laughter bouncing off those hallowed auditorium walls. And through it all, Evernote and Trello whispered silently beside us, like dear eras of great partnerships, making the journey not just manageable, but quite unforgettable.

We invite you to share in this narrative, to let your projects be next on this great stage of order within chaos—a symphony that Evernote and Trello unite to create. Step onto your stage; the next story awaits!
