# How to Create a Content Calendar with Evernote for Bloggers

Once upon a time – okay, last year, but who's counting – Carol and I found ourselves marooned in the disorganized chaos that was our blog. It wasn't so much a blog as it was a digital scrap heap of ideas that never quite figured out their order. "Surely," I mused, munching on what can only be described as a regretful attempt at homemade granola, "there's a way to craft these nuggets into something cohesive?" Enter Evernote: our unexpected knight in somewhat digital armor.

Our journey with Evernote began atop a mountain of sticky notes – both digital and decidedly not – scattered across screens and desks, haunting our dreams with undone tasks and fragmented inspirations. What Evernote promised was a simple salvation: a coherent grid to map the madness, a content calendar that spoke fluent organization. Here’s how we did it. 

## Starting from the Beginning

Imagine us, wide-eyed, opening Evernote for the first time like it held the secrets of the universe. Admittedly, our initial grasp matched our granola-making skills. Yet, with a few persistent pokes and prods, we found our groove. First things first, we needed to set a foundation.

1. **Create a Master Note**: In Evernote, start by creating a 'Master Note' titled "Content Calendar: [Your Blog Name]." This isn’t just any note – it’s your command center. Like the bridge of the USS Enterprise, but for blog posts.
   
2. **Design with Notebooks and Tags**: We discovered that notebooks and tags were our friends. Create a new notebook titled "Blog Content Calendar" and start tagging notes with relevant labels like "Draft," "Scheduled," "Published." This taxonomy will propel your blog from chaos to clarity.

3. **Template Magic**: Evernote lets you concoct custom templates which, let’s be honest, is like giving your creativity wheels. We devised a simple template: a table with columns for ‘Title,’ ‘Due Date,’ ‘Status,’ and ‘Notes.’ This turned out to be equivalent to discovering fire – but for bloggers.

```markdown
| Title        | Due Date | Status    | Notes        |
|--------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Blog Post 1  | MM/DD/YY | Scheduled | Blah content |
| Blog Post 2  | MM/DD/YY | Draft     | Blah content |
```

## Brainstorming Sessions: Creativity Unleashed

We soon realized the only thing more fulfilling than color-coded spreadsheets is a brainstorming session. Carol and I, armed with cups of questionable herbal tea, found ourselves surrounded by sticky notes. Once we’d wrestled our golden content nuggets from the ether, we immortalized them in Evernote.

1. **Capture Ideas on the Fly**: Use Evernote’s mobile app. Whether you're struck by inspiration mid-grocery shop or in line for mediocre coffee, jot your genius down with the app. Capturing fleeting thoughts is as thrilling as it sounds.

2. **Notes, Everywhere**: Create notes for each idea within your "Blog Content Calendar" notebook. Jot down every quirky notion or clever title that pops up – Hemingway didn't write sober, and who’s to say we should blog traditionally?

3. **Sort and Conquer**: Begin methodically sorting these rambles into something legible. Who knew sorting could feel this powerful? Or maybe that was the caffeine.

## Scheduling Posts: A Tale of Taming Time

Next came the realization that deadlines could be friendly companions instead of looming specters. Okay, maybe not friendly, but tolerable at least.

1. **Assign Deadlines**: With the google calendar integration, we scheduled each blog post by dragging and dropping it on the calendar like it was Jenga, or Tetris – but without impending doom if we got the timing a tad wrong.

2. **Deadline Reminders**: We set up reminders on Evernote. It's like having a personal assistant whisper periodically, “Have you written today?”

3. **Adjust and Adapt**: Let's be real; life happens. Your 'ultimate guide to alpaca trends' might not go up this week. And that's okay. Move it. Nobody's judging.

## Collaboration Station: Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

Carol and I weren't always in the same caffeine-fueled room – shocking, I know. But Evernote's collaborative features made us feel like we were, enabling co-creation from our personal corners of chaos.

1. **Share the Calendar**: Utilize Evernote’s sharing options. We sent our blog calendar with third party interlopers (our guest writers, that is), in one swift digital motion.

2. **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time editing meant our ideas interlaced smoothly – like a well-crafted conspiracy theory – devoid of unruly backtracking and confusion.

3. **Feedback Loop**: Sensei Carol added comments right inside the notes, allowing me to digest feedback at my own pace – like chocolate, but less calorically concerning.

## Reviewing and Refining: The Journey Never Ends

Remember our wild, sticky notes wilderness? Our calendar, like a fine wine (or aged cheese), matured over time.

1. **Periodic Review**: Set aside time – perhaps weekly, perhaps monthly, perhaps under a full moon – to examine the calendar. This helps identify if your ‘Top 10 Foods You Thought Were Kale’ post should really come ahead of ‘Guide to Underappreciated Rutabagas.’

2. **Update and Refresh**: Refresh outdated ideas and update your calendar. We looked upon our content calendar with a sense of pride, threatened only by an occasional inexplicable rush of melancholy.

3. **Lessons Learned**: Reflect on past posts. Refrain from repeating tragic errors (looking at you, granola). Learn. Adapt. Survive.

## Conclusion: The Organized Path Ahead

As Carol and I sit here reflecting on our journey with Evernote, which began with a confused collective bang and ended in nervously proud order, we are convinced: organization is within reach for all bloggers. Evernote, with its flexibility and structure, can turn chaos into a symphony of calmed schedules and intentional content.

So there you have it, friends. We've survived the tempest of disorganization, one note at a time, and come out the other end with a content calendar that's both tame and fulfilling. Imagine that! It was almost as rewarding as stumbling upon the perfect recipe for a granola bar that doesn’t masquerade as wall plaster. Good luck, fellow blogger – may your drafts be ever clear, your posts be ever-lively, and your deadline reminders only sort-of terrifying.
