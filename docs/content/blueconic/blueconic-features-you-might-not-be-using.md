# BlueConic Features You Might Not Be Using

So there I was, sitting in our cramped office surrounded by a constellation of coffee mugs and papers, when Mark from marketing burst in with the exuberance of a caffeinated squirrel. He’d just discovered a new BlueConic feature that “could change everything.” Skeptical, I raised an eyebrow, and asked, “Hasn’t it all been discovered already?” With a grin worthy of a kid unlocking a secret level in a video game, Mark started explaining. This was a watershed moment in our BlueConic journey, and little did we know it would spark the content of this very article.

## Unified Customer Profiles – The Hidden Gem

Remember that time when sorting through endless data sheets felt like untangling holiday lights? Us too. One day, as we clawed through immense data jungles, we discovered something magical. Unified Customer Profiles. It’s this savvy feature where BlueConic gathers all that scattered customer data into one cozy, digital living room. Sarah from our team likens it to putting together a puzzle without losing a single piece under the couch (where dust bunnies dwell). 

Here’s how you wrangle with it:
1. **Login to BlueConic** and navigate to the 'Profiles' tab. 
2. **Select ‘New Profile’** to begin creating.
3. **Define sources** you’d like to unify – the more the merrier! Think CRM, social media, and more.
4. **Map your fields** meticulously. Map like you’re on a treasure hunt, linking attributes with keen precision.
5. **Activate the profile**, ready to tell stories previously unreadable.

Each step was a revelation, like discovering a forgotten corner of a well-loved bookshop. Oh, but it didn’t end there.

## The Lego of Data: Flexible Data Storage

Once, during a frantic brainstorming session, Isabelle yelled, “What if we could just stack our data like Lego blocks?” We laughed, until stumbling upon BlueConic’s Flexible Data Storage feature. Voilà! Imagine data pieces fitting seamlessly, no glue required. It’s delightful to watch our data dance together in harmony, no longer forced into clunky formats that remind you of a poorly fitting sweater.

1. **Access the 'Data Storage' settings** within your platform settings.
2. **Create new storages** or adjust existing ones, ensuring they’re keenly organized.
3. **Customize fields** as desired. BlueConic lets you make it bespoke - tailored like a fine suit.
4. **Link with existing profiles** to overlay storages within the unified profiles. 
   
And there we were, awestruck like kids seeing snow for the first time, reveling in the potential of it all. We giggled at how easily accessible and malleable our data became.

## Segmentation Wizardry Dreams Are Made Of

Ah, segmenting. What a love-hate relationship we’ve had! It parallels picking teams in school – favoritism abounds, doesn’t it? Thankfully, BlueConic’s wizardry in segmentation took us on an exhilarating ride. It was like a sorting hat, only with advanced segmentation skills.

1. **Navigate to the 'Segments' tab**; it’s a treasure trove for marketing intelligentsia.
2. **Create a new segment**, infusing creativity over mundane.
3. **Select criteria** with precision. Remember Clara’s mantra: “Focus on behavior, not just demographics.”
4. **Test your segment** by running simulations. BlueConic lets us play without real-world stakes. 
5. **Activate and use** in campaigns like a well-aimed skittle gun.

Segmentation halted all aimless targeting. We chuckled at past missteps like overenthusiastic darts missing the bullseye. 

## Passion for Personalization: Dialogue in Real-Time

One afternoon, chatting about dreams of making websites utterly personal, we discovered the real-time capabilities hidden within BlueConic’s Dialogue feature. Finally, the power to make content sing directly to the user - as if each reader had a personal bard. Joe, our content guy, was thrilled to compose stories within parameters we never thought could be individualized.

1. **Create dialogues** via the ‘Dialogues’ selection.
2. **Choose triggers** that resonate – let them speak to the heart!
3. **Customize interactions** through every channel. Sculpt the user journey like Michelangelo at his finest.
4. **Test with sample profiles** to finetune our narrative like a maestro perfecting a symphony.
5. **Implement it live** – a story tailored for every singular visitor.

It’s a heady feeling, like hosting guests in a house custom-built to each of their desires, aimed directly into their passions.

## Journey Mapping and Execution

Once, Jakob, our office wanderer, lamented about fragmented customer journeys. BlueConic’s journey mapping offered a serendipitous path like guided ropes helping climbers on Everest. It felt like assembling IKEA furniture with clear instructions – a miracle one even!

1. **Design customer journeys** within the journeys tab.
2. **Plot touchpoints** that matter – think of it as setting waypoints in a grand adventure.
3. **Allocate resources** smartly. Jakob insists on distinct touchpoints where customers linger.
4. **Integrate actions and goals**, delightfully connecting journeys to profiles and dialogues.
5. **Continuously monitor** using dashboards and tune performances like a guitarist adjusting strings.

We felt a kinship like that between co-travelers on a long hike, exploring the heights and depths of consumer relationships.
