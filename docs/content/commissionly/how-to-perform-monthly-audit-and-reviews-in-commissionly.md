# How to Perform Monthly Audit and Reviews in Commissionly

## The Journey Begins

"How did I get here?" I mused one sticky afternoon, the sun starting to tiptoe across my desktop. I sat there, a spreadsheet whisperer at heart, contemplating the thrum of a new task—performing a monthly audit and reviews in Commissionly. It was not my first rodeo with software, but there I was, treading into an ocean of commissions and numbers, each data point more mysterious than a cat that doesn’t knock things off tables. It was then that I realized: this whole auditing gig was less about battling columns and more about weaving a story from data—discovering the heartbeat within the pixels. Let’s dive into how we do that.

## Step 1: Cracking Open the Commissionly Vault

Flashback to when my cat, Sir Whiskers, decided to join my meeting, his tail flicking over my laptop keyboard, accidentally opening Commissionly. “Sir Whiskers!” I exclaimed, but then paused—perhaps it was a sign. With Whiskers’ unintentional nudge, I logged into Commissionly with ease, heading straight to the “Overview” dashboard. It’s a bit like that feeling you get when opening a fresh jar of peanut butter—smooth, full of potential. 

- Access the Commissionly platform.
- Make sure you’re greeted with the “Overview” dashboard.
  
## Step 2: Harvesting Data Like a Pro

Sir Whiskers watched (or critiqued, probably). I surveyed the data fields: commissions earned, sales targets, achieved percentages—each datum a ripe apple ready for picking.

- Navigate to the “Reports” section.
- Generate a report for the desired month. Choose “Monthly Reports” for this task.
- Select the fields necessary for your audit—earnings, goals, achievement ratings.
  
## Step 3: Diving into the Sea of Details

We leaned back, letting the data wash over us in waves, soaking in numbers as if it were poetry. Perhaps we are all heroes on our own data-driven quests.

- Drill down into specific entries if they seem like odd ducks in a line of ducklings.
- Analyze the 'Sales by Representative' section to ensure each member’s contributions align with targets.
  
## Step 4: Compare, Contrast, Collaborate

Honestly, comparing is just smack-talking without the guilt. My inner voice urged, driven by a tea-fueled frenzy. We matched this month’s results to previous months, the patterns and outliers in plain sight.

- Generate a comparative report for previous months for context.
- Use filters to sort and visualize fluctuations, anomalies, and trends. Let graphs be your truth-tellers.

## Step 5: Giving Feedback with an Open Heart

We turned numbers into sentences, feedback that could guide like breadcrumbs through a forest. This part was crucial; not all heroes wear capes, some type feedback.

- Draft constructive comments and points for improvement.
- Engage with team members by sharing insights in a collaborative setting, maybe over doughnuts—always remember, doughnuts make everything better.
  
## Step 6: Embrace the Unexpected and Adjust

Remember the joy of imperfect pottery? That’s auditing—celebrating both perfect symmetry and lopsided charm. We adapted plans and goals as necessary. Sir Whiskers purred his approval (or disdain, it’s hard to tell).

- Adjust targets and strategies as needed based on findings.
- Document any new processes or changes in policy for accountability.

## The Reflective Pause: Why We Audit

Amongst the hum of numbers and caffeine-induced moments of clarity, the essential truth emerged: auditing is about ensuring accuracy, certainly, but also about understanding. It’s about finding how each piece fits into the grand mosaic of your organization. Because in the end, each audit is our opportunity to connect deeply with the flow of our shared journey.

That’s how we audit and review in Commissionly—not just a process, but an exploration. Whether you’re warrior or wayfinder, may your audit adventures be as enlightening as a cat hitting the correct shortcut keys in a stroke of chance. And remember, in every cluster of numbers, there lies a narrative just waiting to be told. Let us embrace it, cherish it, and most importantly, have fun with it. Even Sir Whiskers agrees, and he surely has the last word around here.
