# How to Generate Custom Reports in Commissionly for Sales Analysis

Once upon a time, in a not-so-distant past, I found myself knee-deep in a quagmire of spreadsheets. Sales numbers sprawled across the screen like hieroglyphics, mocking my attempts to make sense of their cryptic language. The room was alive with the gentle hum of computers, juxtaposed against the rising crescendo of frustration. It was at that very moment when Bob—our in-house tech-savvy wizard—strolled over, sat quietly beside me, and whispered the three magic words that would change everything: "Use Commissionly reports."

And so began our journey into the world of custom reports. Together, let’s unravel the delightful tapestry of Commissionly and how it can turn your chaotic data into a symphony of clarity.

## Setting up Commissionly: Where the Magic Begins

Picture this: a blank canvas waiting for a splash of vibrant colors. Before we can dive into creating our masterpiece of a report, we first need to set up our Commissionly account. Bob, bless his soul, led the way. 

1. **Create an Account** - We registered ourselves, and Commissionly rolled out the welcome mat. If you fancy, take your time to explore the dashboard—a landscape of possibilities.
  
2. **Integrate with Your CRM** - Like introducing peanut butter to jelly, we synced Commissionly with our trusty CRM (Customer Relationship Management). It's a seamless handshake—promise.

3. **Import Sales Data** - With a swift flick of the wrist, we imported the sales data. We watched as numbers flowed like an elegant waterfall from one system to another.

Bob, with his infectious enthusiasm, coined the phrase, “Data is the new oil”. We laughed, but he wasn't wrong. Underneath those numbers lay the nuggets of wisdom we sought.

## Navigating the Dashboard: Our Exploration Begins

The dashboard was intimidating at first—a beast of many gauges and charts. But soon, it felt like home.

- **Analyze Existing Reports** - Bob took lead: shoes off, reclined chair, and a simple drag across the screen. We scrutinized those pre-made reports. Who were they? Friends or foes? Oddly satisfying, like preparing a jigsaw puzzle’s edges.

- **Create a New Custom Report** - We took a leap. That little ‘Create Report’ button—our gateway to glory.

### Step 1: Choosing a Report Template

Templates, I mused, are like pie crusts, providing structure while the essence of the report—the filling—can be as you desire. Commissionly presented choices aplenty: sales performance, team evaluation, product ranks. A smorgasbord where we feasted until we found the one.

### Step 2: Selecting Data Points

Here's where the real fun began. With a spirit of discovery akin to a kid with a box of Legos, we chose data points.

- **Sales Figures**? Check.
- **Customer Feedback**? Why not?
- **Regional Performance**? Absolutely.
  
Our selections painted the kind of picture we'd only sketched in dreams.

### Step 3: Adding Filters

I remember Bob quoting an ancient proverb, "More data doesn’t always equate to wisdom." Thus, we filtered.

- **By Date** - To capture seasonal ebbs and flows.
- **By Team** - Providing a spotlight for both heroes and underappreciated warriors.
  
The dance between data and filters was seamless—a gentle give-and-take, as poetic as the rise and fall of ocean waves.

### Step 4: Crafting Visuals

With data points selected, we pondered visual representation. Bob, fondly remembering his art school days, advocated for pie charts—friendly and digestible.

- **Bar Graphs** - Great for comparing performance across metrics.
- **Line Charts** - Perfect for trends.

A sneak peek into Greek mythology, visuals were our Sirens—attracting and holding our gaze.

## Finalizing and Generating the Report: The Grand Unveiling

Fresh coffee aroma wafted through the office as we stopped to admire our creation, like artists observing a newly finished painting. This part was easy, almost anticlimactic. 

1. **Set the Parameters**: Title and format. Simple yet powerful, every piece important.
2. **Generate**: With a click, our report leapt into existence. A tangible artifact of our labors.

We smiled, satisfied, and then turned our thoughts to sharing.

## Sharing the Report: Broadcasting Insights

How does one spread the legend of a report? We soon found out.

- **Email It**: Like sending a postcard to Grandma. Reliable.
- **Export Options**: CSV for the purist, PDF for the minimalist.

Bob, ever mischievous, also imagined sharing it on social media. We laughed, but spreadsheets might be the next cat photos, who knows?

In retrospect, we realized that our journey wasn’t just about learning how to use Commissionly. It was a rediscovery of creativity—a merging of art and science. Custom reports in Commissionly are delightful blends of numbers and stories, like sunsets that leave you breathless.

As we closed the chapter on this challenge, walking away wasn't a separation but a "see you later” to Commissionly's rich possibilities. And if another befuddled wanderer should cross our path, we’d promptly pass on the magic words: "Use Commissionly reports." 

And thus, dear reader, our tale ends. Or perhaps, it’s just the beginning of yours. Now, it's your turn. Go forth and create.
