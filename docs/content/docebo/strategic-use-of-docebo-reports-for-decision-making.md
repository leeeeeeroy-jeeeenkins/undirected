# Strategic Use of Docebo Reports for Decision Making

Do you remember the first time you cracked the Rubik’s Cube? I sure do. It felt like peeling the layers of an onion, each twist unveiling another complex side. This particular day was at the break of dawn, my coffee mug teetering on the edge of the table, and the cube misshapen from countless failed attempts. That’s exactly how I felt the first time I opened up Docebo’s reporting dashboard. Wildly colorful. Slightly terrifying. But oh, so satisfying once I got into it.

We were tasked with understanding our training program's impact, and Docebo’s reports seemed like the solution. At first, the dashboard looked like an art show with abstract paintings — beautiful and confusing. But just like that cube, the more we explored, the more pieces began fitting together, until, voilà! It all made perfect sense.

## Uncovering Hidden Patterns in Data

My brain loves mysteries, and deciphering Docebo reports felt just like unraveling a good detective novel. We started by gazing at the overview reports. A team, cloistered in a room with walls dressed in sticky notes — each one mapping our trajectory from data confusion to data comprehension. We brewed lots of coffee that day; funny how caffeine seems to accompany clarity, isn't it?

Importantly, we realized reports aren't just numbers. They’re like echoes of our learners' journeys, vibrating through our programs. With Lizzy from marketing exclaiming over a surge in course completions and Jake, our data wizard, applying his algorithmic wizardry to forecast trends, it soon became a crafted dance. Different departments working together to sew a cohesive story from the threads of data.

### The Sweet Spot of Custom Reports

When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade, right? And when Docebo gives you data, you make custom reports. Let’s dive into how it went. Hannah, perched on the tip of her chair, tapping her pen like a metronome, dared to venture into the jungle of customization. She came back with a wild grin and a wealth of insights that made us wonder why we hadn’t done this sooner.

**To begin customizing your own report:**

1. **Navigate to the Reports tab**. Here, you will discover a galaxy of potential waiting to be tailored.
   
2. **Select ‘Create a Custom Report’**. This button is like opening the gateway to Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory — without the risk of turning into a blueberry.
   
3. **Choose your data fields**. Field by field, you’ll build your perfect report. Hannah, in her meticulous nature, spent hours fine-tuning. Just add, rearrange, and let the magic happen.
   
4. **Apply filters** to really zoom in. Do you want to know how often people from Sales finish their courses on time? Set a filter. Filters are the GPS to navigating this brimming data ocean.

5. **Visualize and adjust** until your heart sings. These adjustments are crucial. Curate your visuals like embarking on a painting session — colors, shapes, bar graphs, oh my!

Suddenly, deciphering data felt less like climbing Everest and more like strolling through a sunflower field.

### Templates and Automation: The Double Espresso Shot

Ah, templates and automation. These became our double espresso shots on dull days. Bill, with his penchant for anything that optimized time, was our automation maestro. Once we got our custom reports just right, Bill saved them as templates. 

Speaking of templates:

- **Save time** with pre-designed report templates.
- **Share with others** easily, because knowledge grows when shared.
- Automate report **distribution**, like scheduled emails that become our very own Santa, delivering insights on the regular.

Bill loved how simple it was. Perhaps too much, as he proudly watched his “Delivery Automation” list grow like a garden in spring. Think of it as a set-it-and-forget-it way of delivering fresh-brewed data straight to our inboxes.

### Real-Time Reporting: The Instant Gratification

“You mean...this is updated...right now?” Janine asked, eyes wide in disbelief. Real-time reporting was the shockwave that ran through our team. Suddenly, waiting for end-of-month reports felt as obsolete as a VCR.

Real-time reporting kicked our decision-making game up a notch. And the best part? It’s as simple as setting up a streaming playlist. 

- Access the **real-time dashboards** under the Reports section. These are interactive, alive, and pulsing with the here and now.
- Watch as data changes instantaneously — a living, breathing set of insights.
- Use these fresh insights to make quick decisions, like a sculptor chipping away to gently reveal Mona Lisa.

Janine indulged in checking these reports daily. Her spontaneity and this function were a match made in heaven.

### The Human Side of Analytics

Docebo reports aren't just bits and bytes. They’re reflections of human endeavors and accomplishments. When our team first realized this, it hit us like a sunrise after a stormy night. These numbers represented real people, signing in, progressing, achieving. 

We had discussions, sitting cross-legged on beanbags — because no one can be stressed while beanbagging — talking about what these metrics really meant for improving user experiences.

Anna from HR perplexingly wondered aloud about satisfaction scores versus course completion. Could it be some courses just didn’t engage? Turns out, yes. Our team worked to enhance the learner experience, turning each insight into action. What was initially pieces to a puzzle, soon became a lively mural of improvement.

## Bringing It All Together

If our experience taught us anything, it's that Docebo reporting isn't just a tool. It's a story. A Rubik’s cube of diverse learner experiences waiting to be harmonized. We navigated this journey together and grew not just in our analytics prowess but in understanding the human value of our learning programs.

To think it all started with a chaotic dashboard and a cluttered mind that morning. Successfully cracking the Docebo reports? It was the zenith of an analytical eureka moment. It was like the cube’s colors finally aligned — serene, fitting, utterly satisfying.

So, fellow data explorers, next time you open Docebo’s reports, bring a sense of adventurous inquiry. And maybe — just maybe — a strong coffee.
