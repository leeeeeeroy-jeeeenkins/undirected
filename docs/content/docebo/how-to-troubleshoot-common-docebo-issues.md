# How to Troubleshoot Common Docebo Issues

Okay, picture this: It’s a breezy Monday morning, coffee just within reach, and I'm diving headfirst into the riveting task of explaining Docebo to my team. Enthusiasm sparks in our eyes—like kids who've just found the secret candy stash in a grandma’s old cupboard. Everything seems perfect! Then, out of nowhere, BAM! An error message. Like a rude party crasher, it’s standing tall, blocking our cheerful path. This is not my first tango with learning management systems—oh no, they’re as unpredictable as a lemonade stand in July—one minute serving sweet delight, and the next, leaving you with a sour note. So, buckle in! Let’s embark on this peculiar odyssey of troubleshooting Docebo issues. Together.

## The Mystery of the Missing Button

Remember when Kathy from Marketing, in her usual jaunty tone, asked, “Where’s the button to access reports?” Good question, Kathy! As elusive as a cat during bath time, this little button seemed to vanish into the ether. A classic case of the disappearing act.

### Step 1: Check User Permissions
First, peek into the user permissions—our unsung heroes or silent villains. Ensure the user has the right to see those magical reports. It's like giving someone the house keys. Without it, they’re just awkwardly peering in through the windows.

### Step 2: Review Dashboard Settings
Next, navigate through the dashboard settings, like a pig through a corn maze. Ensure all settings reflect the shimmering, radiant world you expect. Sometimes, these settings have a mind of their own and decide to reset themselves. Fun times!

### Step 3: Update the System
Ever felt an app just needed a heart-to-heart and a firmware upgrade to boot? Docebo occasionally fancies the same. A quick system update might bring back that runaway button. Simple, though you might need to call on your inner tech guru.

## The Case of the Vanishing Notifications

Sue from Finance, bless her persistent heart, complained one blustery afternoon that her notifications had gone AWOL. Well, well, well, let's join her on the hunt for those troublesome pings.

### Step 1: Check Notification Settings
Investigate the notification settings—similar to wondering where you last put your keys. Ensure these are switched on and configured to ping you as expected, Sue.

### Step 2: Examine Spam/Junk Folders
Oh, the Spam folder—it’s like the attic of emails, where lost treasures reside. Sometimes notifications go there to hide, alongside forwarded chain letters from the 90s. Dig through, and you might just strike gold—or find your notifications.

### Step 3: System Maintenance
Docebo occasionally partakes in maintenance; who doesn’t love a bit of self-care? Check if notifications were affected during recent maintenance windows. Play the waiting game, the one we are all too familiar with.

## The Enigma of the Slow Load Times

One magical day, while sappily sipping my cappuccino, I noticed the platform slower than a snail trudging through peanut butter. Cue the sigh of disbelief! But worry not. Speed demons, rejoice!

### Step 1: Evaluate Internet Connection
First, ask yourself, have the WiFi gremlins come out to play? Check your internet connection because Docebo loves a stable, quick internet highway.

### Step 2: Browser Cache Clearing
Browsers, too, need a little spring-cleaning from time to time. Clear your browser’s cache. Like wiping away tiny digital cobwebs for a fresh start.

### Step 3: Disable Browser Extensions
Ah, browser extensions. Ever helpful but sometimes a tad overzealous. Disable them temporarily to see if one of these little helpers is causing the slowdown. Easier than dealing with guests overstaying their welcome.

## The Perplexing Puzzle of Incomplete Course Completions

“Why does it say my course isn't complete?” asks Jon, the tenacious trainee. He finished it twice—right to the end credits, so he says. This could be akin to running a marathon and still needing those victory snacks.

### Step 1: Check Course Requirements
Take a moment to review the course requirements. Is there a cheeky quiz or assignment that slipped under the radar? Sometimes the smallest details are the sneakiest.

### Step 2: System Glitch Check
Docebo might be having a dizzy spell. A quick check of the system’s health status page can reveal if it’s a system issue masquerading as user error.

### Step 3: Re-attempt Completion
Encourage the user to reattempt the final sections or quizzes. A repeat performance ensures the data syncs with the platform—much like a two-step reassurance hug.

## The Unsolved Mystery of Error Codes

Error codes, they’re like dreams speaking a language all their own, a lingo only understood by the gods of tech support—or are they?

### Step 1: Decode the Error Message
Have you ever played detective with a riddle? Look at the error message and search the Docebo support center or forums. You might find a community hero who has slayed this mythical beast before.

### Step 2: Clear Cache
When in doubt, and after turning it off and on again (the mantra!), clear your browser's cache. Surprisingly effective—think of it as rebooting your brain with a brisk morning jog.

### Step 3: Contact Support
Finally, throw your hands into the air and contact Docebo support for those stubborn, cryptic errors. Sometimes we need Chuck Norris-level help, and that's okay.

## The Daring Escapade of the Customization Conundrum

Julie from Customer Service wants Docebo as jazzed up as a '50s diner with all the chrome trimmings. Make it work seamlessly with the company’s vibe.

### Step 1: Explore Theme Customization Options
Docebo’s theme customization features, when handled deftly, are as versatile as a Swiss army knife. Dive into the display settings and tweak them until Julie's heart sings, and Docebo feels distinctly ‘us.’

### Step 2: HTML and CSS
For the ambitious, braving the surreal HTML and CSS realm can further tailor the platform's look and feel. Proceed with caution, but also with excitement.

### Step 3: Seek Expert Help
When DIY becomes BYO (Bring Your Own confusion), remember to call in the experts. Customization can be an art form—sometimes best left to the hands of Leonardo himself.

## The Adventure of the Unlogged Logs

Logs: the backstage passes of Docebo’s grand performance. Discover them, and you’ve found your own Rosetta Stone of resolving technical mysteries.

### Step 1: Access System Logs
Don the detective cap and access the logs. They reveal the who’s, what’s, when’s, and where’s of issues. A bit like reading an intricate novel of data intrigue.

### Step 2: Analyze Errors
Look through these logs for tales of errors past. You'll find clues—bits of breadcrumbs that lead down the troubleshooting path. 

### Step 3: Implement Solutions
Use the intel from the logs to fix the issues. It feels like triumph over chaos when the eureka moment happens, akin to finding $5 in your jean pocket unexpectedly.

With each solution discovered, each bug squashed, laughter shared, and problems merely stepping stones to success, our Docebo journey becomes a little brighter, a little less mysterious. So let’s raise our digital mugs to the wonder of discovery and the quirky joy of solving Docebo-like enigmas, one troubleshooting step at a time! Cheers, dear friend. You’ve got this!
