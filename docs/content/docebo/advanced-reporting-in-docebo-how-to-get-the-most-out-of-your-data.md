# Advanced Reporting in Docebo: How to Get the Most Out of Your Data

You remember that time when we sat, coffee cups steaming, immersed in a pile of spreadsheets, trying to make sense of it all? We can laugh about it now, but back then, it felt like trudging through molasses with blindfolds on. I recall Jen was there, complaining about the lack of reporting options in our dusty old system. And then Max tossed out a lifeline: "Ever heard of Docebo?" Fast forward a few months, and here we are, deep-diving into Docebo’s advanced reporting features like seasoned pros — or at least like those with a reliable floatation device in this vast sea of data. 

## Starting with the Basics, Yet Not Really

When we first opened Docebo, it was like stepping into a world where data wasn't the enemy. It was like someone had turned on the lights. Docebo's interface, thankfully, doesn't overwhelm with endless tabs — plus it's intuitive, a word we grew to cherish and use perhaps a tad too frequently. It's akin to switching from riding a unicycle on cobblestones to cruising on a Tesla. Let’s dive in, shall we?

### Just Getting Your Feet Wet: Navigating the Dashboard

You know those "choose-your-own-adventure" books where every decision could plunge you into calamity or triumph? Docebo’s Dashboard feels a little like that, minus the life-threatening escapades. We instinctively clicked around, finding our footing. The Dashboard, with its colorful graphs and charts, quickly became our go-to for quick insights.

- Open **Docebo** and head to your **Dashboard**. The setup might remind you of a treasure map.
- Your First Mate, the **Reports Menu** — click on it like it’s your favorite song.
- Behold the **Report Widgets**! Drag-and-drop it like a boss. Customize what you need to paint that perfect data picture.
  
Remember when Jen accidentally deleted a widget? We still bring that up during lunch for a good chuckle. It’s a place to experiment and learn.

### Venturing Deeper: Creating Custom Reports

Crafting a custom report is sort of like building the perfect sandwich — it takes time, a bit of trial and error, and little victories along the way. We found ourselves playing around with options, adjusting here and there until it tasted just right.

1. **Go to Reports**. Click **Custom Reports** like you’re magic.
2. Now, the fun begins. Choose your **Type** — Learner, Course, or Learning Plan. It feels like picking your favorite ice cream.
3. Bring those details in. **Columns**? Easy. Pick what you need. **Filtering**? Pick your specific flavor.
4. Hit **Run** — fingers crossed for no bananas in our sundae — and, voila!

We accidentally left Max's favorite learner detail out of our first report, but no worries, we learned to double-check before running wild.

### Going Off the Beaten Track: Advanced Filters

Filters are like the unsung heroes of reporting. They don’t get flashy parades, but without them, we’d be lost in a sea of irrelevant data. Jen called them our guardian angels. Not sure if they caught her lunchtime poetry, but they truly had their way of navigating us to the right answers.

- Visit **Generate Report**
- Find those hero filters and engage them. Use them to narrow your scope.
- Like mining gold — don’t be afraid to sift through the debris.

Remember that time Max found a flawed report because we forgot to exclude inactive users? Classic tale of filter oversight!

### Embracing the Complexity: Calculated Variables

Now, if you want to channel your inner Einstein, calculated variables are where the magic happens. It's like going from Lego Duplos to expert level with Technic pieces — a bit complex but incredibly rewarding when it all snaps into place.

- Go to your **Reports**
- Discover **Calculated Variables**. It’s like discovering hidden talents in your old friend.
- Channel those talents into expressions. Begin with **simple arithmetic**, then venture into more complex logic.

We made our first calculated variable with all the grace of a cat on a hot tin roof, but we got there. Now they save us endless time.

## Taking Your Data Further: Exporting and Sharing

Now let’s talk about the social butterfly in us. Once we’ve created something rad with our data, the impulse is to share it like a proud parent whose toddler just took its first steps.

### Exporting Reports: Taking the Show on the Road

Like gifting a dazzling scarf knit by granny, exporting these reports feels equally fulfilling.

- Hit **Export**, choose *PDF* or *Excel* — it’s as simple as sending a text, but we felt like pioneering the circuits of innovation.
- Double-check details — or risk sending a birthday invite with the wrong date!

Jen had a close call with a report sent to the big boss — misplaced columns have become a legendary faux pas. But with Export Preview, we've got her covered.

### Automating Delivery: Reports Land Directly in Your Inbox

If sending an email was a daily jog, then automating report delivery was like setting the treadmill to run itself — pure genius.

- Go to **Automations**
- Schedule your reports like you schedule dentist appointments — only with enthusiasm!
- Set the frequency, the recipient, and breathe easy knowing your report train is chugging smoothly.

We’ve had ours set to swing by every Monday at 9 a.m. — it’s become an office tradition.

## Reflecting on Our Data Adventure

Sitting back down with warm cups, surrounded by all the insights we can muster, we realize this isn't just about numbers. It’s about piecing together stories, unearthing opportunities, and sometimes, believing that our spreadsheets, like some obscure band, will one day make it big.

Who would've thought a simple suggestion would lead to this grand data dance? In the end, advanced reporting in Docebo is all about navigating with a shared compass, occasionally laughing at our mishaps, and never, ever forgetting that one time we nearly drowned in spreadsheets.

So here’s to more adventures, more discoveries, and maybe — just maybe — a few more inside jokes along the way.

And remember, if data ever feels like a tangled disco ball of chaos again, we'll be right there with you, coffee in hand, ready to untangle it.
