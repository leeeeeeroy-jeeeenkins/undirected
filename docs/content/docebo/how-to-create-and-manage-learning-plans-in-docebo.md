# How to Create and Manage Learning Plans in Docebo

I remember the moment when everything clicked. It was a late Tuesday afternoon, and our team was gathered around this ancient wooden table—one of those tables that seemed to have been witness to countless stories before ours—in the cramped back room of our startup office. We were frazzled from back-to-back meetings, and the coffee pot was running on—shock horror—decaf. We all wanted to upskill, to forge ahead into the uncharted territories of our professional futures, yet, like every hearty band of misfits, we were all over the place with our learning needs. Enter Docebo! Our beacon. Our very own virtual classroom having somehow snuck its way into our world like a well-timed plot twist in season two of your favorite show.

## Diving into Docebo: The Unlikely Hero

Gather close, my friends, for we set the stage. Docebo wasn't some mythical beast we'd been hearing whispers of in workgroup corners; it was like this unassuming sidekick that suddenly decided to show its superpower, the kind we didn't know we needed. Crunella, our office manager with an uncanny knack for bread baking and organizational prowess, was the first to discover Docebo's treasure chest of features. Oh, how it sparkled with possibilities—to craft learning plans tailored to each of us, like the time she picked out monogrammed mugs for all and nobody else knew they wanted them.

To kickstart this adventure, the first thing Crunella did was to log into Docebo—surprising absolutely no one, really. Once in, she headed to the *Admin Menu*, which is basically like Docebo's version of the wardrobe in Narnia. Here, under the “Learning Plans Management” section, lived the key to create, edit and entice, our eagerly awaited learning plans. Bam! She clicked on “Create Learning Plan,” and off we went.

## Laying Down the Foundations: The Building Blocks

As Crunella led us horizonward, she stressed the importance of blueprints—or learning goals, as normal folk call them—but who are we to say no to dramatics. Specific, achievable goals that didn't just sound neat in a memo, but ones we were all sincerely interested in. This phase wasn't just about blindly adding courses; it was like customizing an epic playlist for a road trip—each track carefully curated.

First things first, she set the **Name** and **Description** for our plan. Consider it naming a pet— would you call a chihuahua “Dragon Slayer”? Precisely. That’s how she approached it: straightforward and with flair. As she filled out these fields, we drank in her blend of practicality and whimsy, noting her tendency to weave motivational quotes from stoic philosophers into the plan descriptions.

Oh! But here’s where it gets even juicier: **Audience and Scope**. Crunella assigned learning plans to both individuals and groups. Bob from sales got his wish of becoming a digital marketing wizard after all, just like he keeps telling everyone at the water cooler. How did she do it? She deftly harnessed Docebo’s user management tools to navigate through learners and grouped them faster than Wren the cat could leap onto the forbidden kitchen counter.

## Stacking Courses: More ‘Build A Bear’, Less ‘Ikea Furniture’

Coming back from a short snack break—Cheddar cheese and crackers, if we're being completely transparent about our journey here—we revisited the great art of course stacking. Crunella ensured each learning plan felt more like a banquet than a sack lunch. 

Inside the **Content** section, she went ahead selecting compulsory courses first—think of this as the veggies of our educational diet. But oh, she didn’t stop there! She added optional courses like sprinkles on an ice cream because every now and then, that little extra can make all the difference. There were filters, search bars, and more filters—a veritable smorgasbord of educational delights to be toyed with. It was a pile of potentially great adventures waiting for our decisions.

## Staying on Track: Managing and Maintaining the Legacy

Like any great quest, our learning plans weren’t intended to live in isolation—a relic to be unearthed and laughed at after dinner parties. No, they needed nurturing—weekly check-ins, adjustments, the occasional serious-talk-about-where-it's-headed relationship talk.

We inputted periodic assessments and checks in the **Maintenance** phase, where adjustments could be playful rather than drab—perhaps adding a surprise module or relating legacy skills in unexpected ways. Crunella made changes like she was decorating a cake, artful and never repetitive. Our learning plans evolved, as did we, a nod to the flow of learning as a lifelong endeavor.

We incorporated feedback from all plan participants. That's right, dear reader, we weren’t just one-sided conversationalists but active listeners, using the **Reports** section to gather insights and weave those into updates.

## Sharing and Celebrating: The Moment of Realization

Finally, the journey came full circle. When all was said and done, Crunella hit the “Publish” button with a ceremonious flair—think swords raised to the sky, triumph music blaring (or the office equivalent which was Kendra furiously tapping her keys to simulate a trumpet fanfare).

We understood that creating learning plans in Docebo was a journey marked by moments of discovery, each step guided by curiosity mixed with courage and a hint of sensational drama by our storyteller-in-chief, Crunella. It was about creating something resonant and authentic within our microcosm but just as impactful in the macrocosm.

Tune in next time when we recount more tales of workplace enchantment—or just how we finally managed to troubleshoot that pesky printer.
