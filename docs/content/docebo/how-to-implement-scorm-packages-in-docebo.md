# How to Implement SCORM Packages in Docebo

**Introduction: A Tale of Two Clicks**

It began on a drizzly Tuesday afternoon. You know the kind—the sky hung heavy with gray, and the rain drummed a soft, steady beat against the windowpanes. I was comfortably ensconced in a favorite armchair, the kind of chair that feels like an old friend. With a cup of peppermint tea in hand, I embarked on what I thought would be a quick task: uploading a SCORM package into Docebo. Oh, how naive I was. The things we learn.

My colleague, Sarah, had recently sung praises of the magic of SCORM—Sharable Content Object Reference Model, in case you’re wondering (that’s about as technical as we’ll get, promise). She said, with almost evangelical zeal, “Once you get the hang of it, it changes everything.” Of course, that didn’t prepare me for the labyrinthine journey ahead—pop quizzes no one warned me about included. But, like any epic quest with cloud-based heroes and e-learning conundrums, the secret to unlocking this achievement lay within a few simple clicks, which we’ll dissect together, step by step.

## Gathering Your Tools: Preparing the SCORM Package

Remember Bilbo Baggins preparing for his unexpected adventure? That’s us, today, readying ourselves for a SCORM escapade. Before we embark, we need to gather our provisions. You’ll need your SCORM package file. It’s like primary ingredient in this digital recipe.

Ensure your SCORM file is zipped. Much like a neatly packed picnic basket, all components should fit comfortably together. This compact little zip file will be the key to our adventure.

Take a moment to appreciate the diligence required in creating the package. Consider it your pride and joy—like a well-iced cake—not to be underestimated. Once in your possession, pat yourself on the back. You’re ready to meet Docebo.

## The First Few Steps: Logging into Docebo

Navigating Docebo is not unlike stepping into a cozy library for the first time—vast, filled with potential, and slightly intimidating. If you've never logged in, take a deep breath. It’s quite unlike confronting a dragon—much more welcoming.

- **Sign in** using your admin credentials. No secret phrase needed, just the trusty username and password. 
- On the left-hand side, you’ll find the **menu panel**—much like an adventure map illustrating paths. 

Make sure you're using an account with the right privileges; this isn't a time for surprises or "oops I don't have access" moments.

## Diving Straight into Courses

Here, my mind flickers back to Nancy, my tech-savvy mentor, always reminding me to "start with the course section." Her voice rings in my head—slightly sarcastic, always helpful.

- Choose **‘Courses’** from the menu as your starting point—a home base, if you will.
- Click **‘Add Course’** at the top right. Feel the anticipation build—it’s like unwrapping a holiday present.

Name the course anything you like—customarily a title that elicits a spark of joy or identifies its purpose efficiently. Choose “Next.” This isn’t rocket science; more like a treasure hunt minus the compass.

## The Heart of It All: Adding Training Materials

Remember that boxed SCORM package, our prized possession? It’s time. It waited patiently, always destined for greatness.

1. **Click** on the newly created course so its page opens.
2. Locate the **‘Training Material’** tab.
3. Press the **‘Add Training Material’** button. You’re in the zone now—Sarah’s words echoing in the background, "See? It’s quite simple once you’re here."

- Select **‘Upload SCORM Package’** from the list of options.
- Drag and drop or simply select your zipped SCORM file.
  
Here lies a land of waiting—upload bars slowly filling, anticipation mounting. Stretch your legs, take a sip of that left-to-go-cold tea.

## Customization: The Beauty of Personal Touch

Nancy always had this spark when talking about customization—a smile that hinted at endless possibilities.

Once uploaded, delve into the customization settings. Options abound like stars in a midnight sky. Do you want to allow multiple attempts, shuffle questions, set completion rules? These toggles and fields are your sandbox.

- Set the visibility status as **‘Published’**, or keep it in **‘Draft’** if adjustments are desired. Choices, choices!

## Testing the Waters: Preview and Test Course

“The proof is in the pudding,” as my grandmother liked to say—before she would slyly add, “but a taste won’t hurt anyone.” Testing is crucial.

- From the course page, hit **‘Preview’** to see things from a learner’s perspective. 
- Check your pacing. Responses. Functionality. Watch it load (or not) like a calm stream—or a torrential rain. Debugging is a rite of passage.

Watch it run beautifully, like a story unfolding through digital ink. Issues? Don’t fret—go back, tweak, and try again.

## Opening the Floodgates: Launching the Course

Finished, tested, polished to a sheen? It’s time to present it to the learners, to open the floodgates and let in the eager explorers.

- **Navigate back to the general course settings.** 
- Change visibility to **‘Published’** if you haven’t already in customization. This is your moment. Don’t shy away.

Let it bask in the glow of attentive eyes, reaching learners far and wide—unassuming in its complexity, brilliant in its execution.

## Reflections and Learnings

After what felt like an odyssey, the package was in place. A soft sense of accomplishment settled in. I couldn’t help but laugh at the earlier apprehensions. We’d navigated the world of SCORM in Docebo together—each step intertwining instruction with discovery.

Remember, it’s more than a task—it’s a connection. Our unexpected adventure on a rainy day, with its twists and turns, showcased the merging of technology with creativity. Our creation stands to educate, inspire, and expand horizons.

As the virtual world continually unfurls, remember to pause and savor these digital journeys—each package, each course is a story just waiting to be told.
