# How to Embed External Resources in Docebo Courses

You know that sudden urgency when you absolutely need to add some zing to your online course at 2 AM, and all responsible adults have long since retreated into their duvet cocoons? Yeah, we’ve been there, doing last-minute-dance moves, fueled by caffeine soup, and staring at Docebo’s interface like adventurers facing the vast Sahara. But, my friends, let's not just survive. Let's thrive. Together, let's talk about weaving external resources through our Docebo courses like resilient spider silk connecting corners of a digital web.

### Unveiling the Mystery of Docebo: Our First Tryst

It was a rainy Tuesday—they’re always rainy, right? Our mentor, Anita, walked in with a smile that whispered tales of digital fortune. She handed us a task: spice up our course with external resources. Wide-eyed and bushy-tailed, we dived into Docebo with reckless excitement only to find ourselves waist-deep in a morass of options and menus. 

Back then, embedding an external resource was like deciphering a love note written in invisible ink. But here's the secret sauce that we discovered after some delightful trial and error. Come along as we unravel the sorcery step by step.

### Step 1: Preparing the Ground

Imagine yourself setting up a campfire—only the kind that ignites curiosity, not marshmallows. Begin by identifying the type of external resource you wish to embed. Maybe it's a video that turns mundane concepts into cinematic explorations or a document more thrilling than the latest mystery novel. The world is your oyster, or maybe just an interesting clam, depending on the day. Make sure that whatever you choose is hosted on a platform that plays nicely with Docebo’s whims—YouTube, Vimeo, or good old Google Docs.

### Step 2: Grasping the Embed Code

Ah, the embed code. It's like the secret handshake of the internet, isn’t it? Once you've found your desired resource, search for the 'Share' or 'Embed' option, which often leads you into a rabbit hole of code strings. Remember when Bob—our tech guy—grumbled about tags and iframes like a grumpy Gandalf? He was onto something. The code typically looks like:

```html
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

Guard it with your life, but also copy it because we’ll need it later.

### Step 3: Entering Docebo's Realm

Fire up that Docebo login screen! Remember how doing it felt like unlocking Narnia’s door the first time? Click on the 'My Courses and Learning Plans' from the panel on the left. Choose the course you want to blaze with your new-found knowledge, and click on 'Edit' like you own the place.

### Step 4: The Magic of Add Widgets 

Here's where the magic happens—or doesn’t, if the gods of widgets don’t smile upon the land. Tap on 'Add Widget,' and greet the creator within. Choose 'HTML Code' widget from the variety pack Docebo offers. Does it remind anyone else of pick-n-mix, or just me?

### Step 5: Pasting the Code

There’s something satisfying about pasting code—you feel like a digital artist painting in binary. Embed your code in the 'Content' box of the HTML widget. Remember Anita's wisdom: “Check it twice—save once.” Verify your code lives happily in the embed sanctuary, without rogue elements around. You wouldn’t want your calculations off by a semicolon.

### Step 6: Save and Preview

Adrenaline kicks in as you hit the 'Save' button—it’s a rocket launch moment. Flip over to 'Preview' because even digital adventurers like us might miss a monkey wrench in the cogs. Ensure your embedded material behaves itself like a well-trained dog at a debutante society gala.

### Evalutaing the Experience: Was it Worth it?

Reflecting on the journey, there will be moments when you feel more Sherlock Holmes than Agnes the Curious Enthusiast. Yes, summarizing knowledge isn’t everyone’s cup of chamomile, but by integrating resources that are alive, we shape leaping learning experiences—ones that dance in our students’ minds well after the logout screen.

Our rainy Tuesday was, surprisingly, an illuminating adventure. We shone a light through our stumbling as a course transformed into a tapestry. And trust us, the sense of accomplishment when it all seamlessly aligns—oh boy, it's as satisfying as untangling a knot of earbuds.

Incorporating external resources in Docebo is our dance between technology and pedagogy—a practical pursuit for some, but for us, it’s a chance to be storytellers in this digital age. Let’s raise our virtual glasses to more late-night epiphanies, clicking, and coding with zeal, crafting educational arcades of joy and discovery.
