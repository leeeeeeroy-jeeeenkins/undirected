# How to Set Up Virtual Classrooms in Docebo

It's funny how things just click. The other day, after years of dodging every invitation to join a webinar or a virtual class - yes, even when my curiosity was piqued - I found myself at the helm of an actual virtual classroom. Not just attending, but setting it up from scratch. There I was, perched precariously on the edge of uncertainty, sipping cold coffee and wrestling with the modern-day monster called Docebo, a learning management system that promised worlds but demanded tribute in the form of my sanity.

## Beginnings Always Seem: Step 1 - Access and Explore

Standing at the threshold of the unknown, feeling quite like a mad scientist about to animate their creation, we need to first log in to Docebo. Begin by navigating to Docebo's website. Should you need an account, create one, much as how Leonardo da Vinci sketched his first line on a blank canvas. Once inside, the dashboard looms before us - an expanse of possibility. 

We sniff around like Sherlock, observing each icon, link, and tab. It's essential to familiarize ourselves with this digital jungle gym. Hover over tabs, click on resources, soak in manuals or guides if they call your name like sirens. 

Let’s not forget to raise a toast to our left sidebar - it’s more useful than a Swiss Army Knife. Here lies the Learning Management section waiting for our curious clicks.

## Echoes of Uncertainty: Step 2 - Find Your Classroom Setting

Here we enter the rabbit hole - the learning modules section. I imagine it much like opening a secret door in a library - revealing a hidden passageway. Click on the "Admin Menu" in the top menu bar. There are so many choices - they almost demand you bring snacks for the journey ahead. Keep an eye out for "Courses & Sessions".

An aside: at this point, halfway through another cold cup of coffee, I started talking to the settings in English with a genuine Italian accent, bunching cousins and gesticulations into each sentence, cursing the screen lovingly. A personal touch is essential.

## Discovery Isn’t Linear: Step 3 - Create A New Course

With thrills of faded trepidations behind us, we must create from nothingness - much like a deity or an artist. In "Courses & Sessions," select "Add new" - a button as welcoming as an old friend. Toys decorously placed, select "Create Training Material." Choose "ILT" (Instructor-Led Training) - not to be mistaken for a species of elf from high fantasy.

Here's the fun part: inputting course details. Name it something catchy like "Wild Wonder of Online Education!" Next, organize accordingly, like setting cups in the cupboard after washing. We chose correctness over chaos - outline the details, train your fingers over the keys, and track the narrative arc of your course. Choose cataloging settings, descriptions, and images that evoke warm memories of campfires and too many marshmallows.

## Moments of Clarity: Step 4 - Design Your Virtual Classroom Session

Imagine you're building a house - we need a sturdy frame before decorating. Back at "Courses & Sessions," select the newly minted course. Here you'll find "Add Training Material" - pivotal yet simple. Choose "Virtual Classroom" - yes, that familiar button with the cryptic promise of real-time connectivity.

Enlist a webinar tool - the braver among us use their preferred platforms, but I invite substantive D&D-style consideration between Zoom and GoToWebinar. Link accounts, if necessary, in a manner reminiscent of forging alliances in medieval courts. Note: wrestle with integrations and save cautious optimism.

Tweak the session's corporeality: title, dates, fated hour of commencement, and allocated minutes or hours. Sprinkle optional details, like time zone or location-based preferences, to taste.

## Marvel and Yes, Bewilderment: Step 5 - Final Tweaks and Invitations 

Our virtual abode now invites final flourishes and necessary incantations. Consider invitations - a proper cast of characters ensures gripping narratives. Back in your course view, find "Enroll Users" akin to keeping guest lists for cheeky soirées.

Docebo’s user base charms us like an intricate tapestry from which we pick attendance, much like threads woven into new patterns, enticing interactions. Choose from groups, associations, or solo adventurers. Release invitations; feel their digital departure with a mix of nostalgia and expectation.

Let students galivant through content access permissions, passed on in the settings with laser-like precision.

## The Joyous Whirr of Success: Step 6 - Launch and Review

The fateful day arrives - much like movie openings or debut theater performances. Navigate to the “My Courses” section, locate your freshly hewn virtual classroom. Drape its link around like triumph woven between inauspicious attempts, then brace yourself for collective understanding and bewilderment.

Once the virtual door opens, we revel in watching real magic happen. Engagement - like wildfire - spreads from knowing chimes and unmute clicks. Be prepared to pivot, adjust, recalibrate - much like a tightrope act in the circus of minds.

Throughout it all, review outcomes. Pore over recordings if enabled, engage with feedback, appreciate laughter at light-hearted errors, or discussions sparked from insightful observations.

## Reflective Interlude - Our Glorious Journey

The whole journey, let us admit, feels much like planting seeds. Nourishment required, slow observations on growth, and eventual blossoming - ever interlinked with our dear Docebo - into an educational Eden. We're not just creating virtual classrooms; we're crafting experiences, nurturing curiosity, and hopefully, just maybe, altering perceptions - even like those we felt years ago when first accepting digital learning’s unassuming challenge.

As we converge from this rhapsody of pixels and caffeine, let’s together savor the adventure. We take a moment to laugh at our mistakes, lift a cheeky eyebrow at our unplanned ingenuity, and step boldly into further Docebo explorations - never mind the unfinished cups of coffee left cold on our desks.
