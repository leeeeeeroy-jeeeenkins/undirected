# How to Build a Successful Learning Pathway in Docebo

It was a chilly morning in April when Mary and I sat huddled around a tiny café table downtown. The kind of morning that makes you fight the thermostat war at home—between saving on the heating bill and avoiding turning into a human popsicle. With the world coming alive over hot coffee and animated chatter, we found ourselves discussing something that fascinated us both: learning pathways. Ever since we’d implemented the Docebo Learning Management System at our company, it felt like we were on an expedition, dusting off the cobwebs of our cognitive caves, navigating the labyrinth of digital learning. And like any great quest, this journey was filled with treasures—discovered knowledge—waiting to be unveiled.

## The Quest Begins: Understanding Learning Pathways

As we sipped our brews, the concept of learning pathways unfurled itself like an old map from Mary’s handbag. She had been tinkering with them to create structured learning experiences for our team. It felt abstract initially—like juggling invisible balls—but soon, we realized it's simply about curating courses and materials in Docebo that lead learners to specific objectives.

### Setting Off: Creating a New Learning Plan

Kicking off a learning plan in Docebo isn't rocket science, but it does unfold like a delicate symphony. Picture yourself composer and conductor.

1. **Initiate the Journey**: In your Docebo LMS dashboard, find the "Learning Plans" section. It’s akin to discovering a hidden room in an ancient library—magical and possibly dusty.

2. **The Grand Title**: Once there, click "Create New Learning Plan." Hand it a name fit for a mantlepiece. The "Ultimate Onboarding Odyssey," perhaps?

3. **Choosing the Path**: Decide whether this pathway should be a linear experience—step by step—or offer some degree of freedom. We chose linear for the onboarding saga because, let’s face it, structure helps when you’re trying to train humans, not cats.

### Gathering the Crew: Adding Courses

With our path laid out, it was time to gather the necessary knowledge—like picking the best apples for your pie.

4. **Select Your Courses**: Click "Add Courses" and pick through the available learning content like a connoisseur. We added “Company Values,” “Intro to Our Industry,” and sprinkled a pinch of “Software Tools 101.”

5. **Setting Prerequisites**: Ah, the classic “You must defeat the dragon before getting the princess” plotline. If some courses need to be completed in a particular order, set them as prerequisites.

## Navigating the Twists: Monitoring Progress

Like any seasoned explorer, you want to keep an eye on your crew’s progress. Mary and I learned to peek into the analytics to see where people soared or stumbled—this was our fieldwork.

6. **Dashboards are your Friend**: In the Admin dashboard, you'll find "Reports." This is your new best friend. Run completion reports to see who’s keeping pace or who might need a gentle nudge.

7. **Check Engagement**: Are learners engaging with the material or are they binge-watching cat videos instead? You'll want to know if your learning plan engages or bores the shoes off of them. Engagement metrics provide these answers—speak softly but carry big data.

### The Fork in the Road: Adjusting the Pathway

Mary’s phone buzzed—her cat, Whiskers, apparently trying to prank call her again. But like Whiskers, not everything goes as planned with learning pathways. You need to adjust, pivot, and adapt.

8. **Make Real-Time Adjustments**: If the learning pathway isn't delivering, make course corrections. You can edit the plan, shuffle courses, or switch learning materials—breaking and molding it like clay.

9. **Seek Feedback**: Talk to the learners. We flipped a coin and decided feedback was crucial after all—like asking directions when lost, embarrassing but effective.

## Reaching the Destination: Certifying Completion

Finally, when learners complete the pathway, it’s like reaching Eldorado, minus the gold. 

10. **Certification Ceremonies**: With Docebo, you can automatically grant certifications. We turned this into a celebratory affair, much like how Whiskers demands a dance every time he catches a mouse—because achievements deserve recognition.

### Reflecting by the Fireside: Continuous Improvement

As Mary and I polished off our muffins and prepared to step back into the bustling world, we realized learning pathways weren't a one-time crusade. They were living, breathing entities, needing constant attention.

11. **Iterate Relentlessly**: Regular reviews and improvements are essential. Like polishing a knight’s armor—keep it shiny, battle-ready, and proudly medieval.

12. **Champion the Learners**: Encourage feedback loops where learners can guide future improvements. They’re your Raftel map—trust their insights.

## Conclusion: The Journey Continues

As we bid farewell to the cozy café and its comforting aromas, it hit us—building a successful learning pathway in Docebo isn’t about reaching a singular destination. It’s ongoing. It's tuning an orchestra, weaving narratives, and shaping a legacy. Together, we laughed at our mistakes, reveled in our victories, and felt a sense of quiet triumph in knowing we were building something meaningful that would enlighten others. “Next time," Mary joked, "let’s add a course on how not to lose your keys every morning."

Rich with knowledge, we stepped out, ready to take on the world—confident that even Whiskers would be proud.
