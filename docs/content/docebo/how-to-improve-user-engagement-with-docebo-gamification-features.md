# How to Improve User Engagement with Docebo Gamification Features

Have you ever found yourself flailing around a new online platform, feeling every bit the neanderthal during the afternoon lull? That's where I was – navigating the labyrinth of Docebo, just like a ship captain without a compass, until I stumbled – or maybe gracefully tripped – over the brilliance of gamification. That's right, gamification, the magical mix of fun and function. You see, Sharon from HQ, two sugars in her coffee with an insistence on almond milk or she’s out, had been on my case. Make learning fun, she kept chirping. Challenge accepted, Sharon.

## Discovering Gamification: The Journey Begins

Picture us: late-night warriors, coffee mugs in hand, ready to tackle the world of gamification in Docebo. It was rumble-tumble chaos at first, like cats herding humans. Using Docebo's gamification feature, the landscape transformed. Suddenly, engagement statistics that looked like sad little undercooked pancakes were the least of our worries.

Let's step into the shoes of those days. First order, visualize it. Think about where we start – on the main dashboard within Docebo. Spot the 'Gamification' link? Click it with gusto. We're into `Settings`. Now, this is where the magic begins.

### Setting Up Game Mechanics

The treasure hunt begins. Ever felt like Indiana Jones in an air-conditioned office space? Because this is it. We start with badges and coins - not the jingling gold kind, but the digital ones worth much more in terms of learning impact. By setting them up, we smiled knowingly, imagining our users chasing these shiny tokens of virtual achievement.

1. **Go to Gamification in the LMS Menu**: This tab will open the door to all game-based opportunities Docebo breathes. Find it, click it, expect the treasure trove.
   
2. **Create Badges**: Selecting 'Create Badge' was like entering a surreal world where learning met fun. We could almost hear the trumpets - or was that the coffee machine?

3. **Design Your Badge**: Get creative here. Choose images that represent the challenge or achievement. Do you have a badge named "Quiz Warrior"? Let’s make it epic – swords and shield icons are welcome.

4. **Assign Criteria**: Now, badges need rules. Assign criteria that users must fulfill to bag that badge. Quizzical expressions and high-fives are optional but recommended.

### Level Up: Using Leaderboards

Imagine turning our learning ecosystem into an Olympic games metaphor—competitive spirit and motivational boosts all around. That's where leaderboards came into play. Participants became motivated Olympians, competing not for gold medals but for digital recognition.

5. **Enable Leaderboards**: From the same Gamification area, tick the box that says ‘Activate Leaderboards’. A chart of virtuosic achievement appears, and so does motivation.

6. **Customize the Competition**: Under 'Leaderboard Settings', tailor the competition. You decide how, when, why. Keep it fair, or unfair but interesting - your call, not mine.

7. **Test the Leaderboard**: We’re talking about quirky moments here - participants calling each other out in good spirit because of the competitive streak you ignited.

## Trophies and Awards: Carrot and Stick Approach

Here's where award reels loop and loop. Only, they're a string of joyful accomplishments. Think Oscars – without the long speeches. We baked rewards into the mechanism, and viola, it was like steam rising off fresh muffins – wholesome, warm, and inviting.

8. **Creating Awards**: Onwards and upwards - create an award from the same toolkit. Think marquee lights and parade confetti.

9. **Define Award Rules**: Sweet spots for 'Award Criteria' ensure that participants achieve success not by fluke but by design. Draft these rules like a mission plan, thoroughly and carefully.

10. **Sequence the Drama**: Stack these rewards in tandem with milestones, making sure participants taste victory at every stage. We made it more of a “together” journey, savoring it at every turn.

## Personal Awkward Learning Moments

Docebo didn’t become just software—it became a theme park of learning. Yes, sometimes it felt like herding fish into a net. Yet, the beauty lied in witnessing the shifts, the changes. Like that moment Eleanor from finance, not a blip on the leaderboard before, cracked the top five because she was hooked on earning her 'Number Cruncher' badge.

### Encouraging Peer Interaction

Now, came the creativity of orchestrating an engaging community where everyone jumps in with both feet. If rewards were the spicy salsa, peer interaction was our crunchy nachos.

11. **Foster Challenges**: Our participants turned into a work-family team, with friendly challenges keeping the banter alive. Use 'Course Challenges' feature - and yes, throw friendly banter while you're at it.

12. **Enable Sharing**: Life’s a stage, Docebo a platform. Encourage peer sharing of badges, scores - let’s not keep our games a secret.

13. **Celebrate Wins**: Little wins are no less a big affair. We cheered the small guys too. With Docebo’s notifications, we turned every badge earned into a celebration.

## Bringing it Together: The Reflective Endgame

Let's share a reflective cup of coffee – granted it's probably gone cold. Reflecting on the entire adventure, we turned Docebo into an arcade, where learning was thrilling not just because of content, but because our colleagues became mercenaries of knowledge, collecting badges and awards - all thanks to the intoxicating power of gamification features. We weren't just observing growth and engagement metrics going bonkers; we were part of a learning revolution.

It's a funny thing, how we began with the simple urge to avoid monotony and ended with a thriving, vibrant learning community. Gamification is unquestionably the friend we never knew we needed. And in forcing us to learn new tricks, it gifted us tales we'll recount over Friday night get-togethers - accompanied by the obligatory pizza and perhaps leading us to reminisce moments like Sharon ernestly chasing a virtual badge instead of a latte.

So folks, let's charge our castles, breathe life into those badges, and watch as your learning community – and your bosses – thank you for the pointy hats, not just the spreadsheets.
