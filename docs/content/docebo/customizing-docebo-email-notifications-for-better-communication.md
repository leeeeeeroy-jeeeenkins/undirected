# Customizing Docebo Email Notifications for Better Communication

A couple of months ago, our quaint little team at Willow Tech Company faced an intriguing conundrum. As the dedicated lest-we-just-call-it-what-it-is "tech wrangler" of the group, I was knee-deep in a terrain of unruly email notifications from our learning management system, Docebo. It all began one morning when Maggie from marketing—our delightful chaos broker—burst into the office, frazzled and talking as if she drank six cups of espresso for breakfast.

"I can’t swim through these notifications anymore! They just keep coming!" she exclaimed, amusingly tugging at her hair. For weeks I had witnessed those unwieldy notifications bombarding our inboxes like a troop of overeager digital rodents. Maggie's outburst became the impetus for our exploration into the captivating world of email notification customization, transforming a cumbersome experience into one of streamlined wonder.

So, no, friends, this isn't just another lifeless manual on email settings. It's the story of our journey through the winding corridors of Docebo. And I promise, we'd make it fun, weaving a story as we go, sort of like upgrading a go-kart with alien technology—exhilarating, awkwardly human, and bursting in color.

## Unveiling the Enigma: Understanding Docebo Notifications

To be honest, the first step was akin to attempting to assemble IKEA furniture without reading the instructions—deciphering the profound complexity that is Docebo's notification settings. We gathered around our roundtable—a mismatched vintage furniture with coffee stains as battle scars—and jumped into our laptops. 

Firstly, here's the real kicker: Docebo notifications revolve around events. That’s your foundation, the bread and butter or grocery list, if you will. Notifications fire off based on specific events within your courses and learning paths. Each event is a trigger, waiting patiently like a cat in a paper bag to notify users about something significant occurring on the platform, whether it's the assignment deadline (que dramatic music), an enrollment confirmation, or celebratory completion thiToast.

### Accessing the Notification Settings

To reach this secret garden of settings, you and your team must be armed with the right permissions—an Admin role. Maggie, Luke, and I—armed with coffee and curiosity—followed these surprisingly simple few steps:

1. **Log in as Admin:** Obvious, right? But you'd be surprised how many times this gets muddled. Our hero, Maggie, almost logged in as a collaborator and nearly missed the train.
   
2. **Head to the 'Admin Menu':** It’s there, typically floating on the left side like a vigilant security guard.
   
3. **Navigate to 'Notifications':** You'll find this option tucked away under the vast umbrella of ‘Settings.’ It’s like those hidden speakeasies you have to whisper the password to enter.

Inside, voila! A panorama of potential, the vast spectrum of pre-configured notifications, most of which were turned ON by default. We realized we'd been receiving notifications for things we didn’t even know existed—possibly the emails' equivalent of receiving a party invitation from a stranger every other day.

## Sculpting the Masterpiece: Customizing Email Notifications

Never before had we understood the beauty of less being more. It was time for us to fine-tune these notifications, to make them as personal and insightful as a handwritten letter from a dear friend.

### Turning Off Unwanted Notifications

The surge of emails was no less than a musical composition gone haywire—too many bass drops. Simplicity was our melody:

1. **Select Notification:** A useful tip—think of this as Marie Kondo-ing your email feed. Unselect the notifications that didn’t "bring you joy."
   
2. **Edit Notification Settings:** By clicking on the pencil icon—the noble 'edit' button—you can adjust each notification’s settings.
   
3. **Disable the Unnecessary Triggers:** We went through the list, similarly to how Goldilocks might test porridge; disabling what was too hot or too cold in importance.

In the end, only those notifications which seemed relevant to our roles and activities remained enabled—sort of like cherry-picking chocolates from an assorted box.

### Crafting Custom Triggers

Then came this exhilarating—and slightly intimidating—part. We decided to go rogue and construct our very own custom notifications, tailored to the rhythms of our team.

1. **Create New Notification:** With a dollop of courage, hit that 'Add' button. A tableau opens up upon which to paint your masterpiece.
   
2. **Choose Event and Trigger:** For instance, when our beloved quarterly training sessions are scheduled, we'd want everyone in the loop. Thus, we selected the 'Session Reminder' event.
   
3. **Compose the Message:** This was where true artistry unfolded—put your personality into it. Our messages were witty, at times punishingly pithy, yet informative.

4. **Assign User Groups:** You can decide who gets the treat. Think of it as choosing a recipient for your finely crafted letter.

The process felt much like customizing toppings on a pizza, each notification becoming an ensemble of flavorful communication rather than a bland affair.

## The Cascade of Consequence: Impact of Customized Notifications

In a rather profound way, as Maggie, Luke, and I celebrated our small tweaking triumph, the ripple effect of these modifications took center stage. Gone were the deluge of irrelevant clutter. Now, the arrival of a notification bore significance, each one crisp—almost poetic. 

### The Symphonic Outcome

Before our very eyes, our inboxes became harmonious instruments, orchestrating communication rather than contributing to a monotonous gray noise. Like a well-brewed cup of tea—strong, fragrant, and surprising with every sip—we discovered the inexplicable joy of an organized mailbox. 

1. **Improved Engagement:** Colleagues, once burdened by notification fatigue, began actively engaging with the platform, knowing each message bore tailored importance.
   
2. **Boosted Productivity:** Without constant distractions of irrelevant reminders, Maggie and the marketing team found focus, navigating tasks with renewed vigor.

3. **Enhanced User Experience:** Everyone felt more connected—interactions became richer—like the moment you smell the garden’s blooms at first light.

## Epilogue: Our Novel Expression

As weeks passed, we marveled at how these curated notifications not only salvaged our sanity but ignited new possibilities for collaboration. We had tamed the anarchy of email alerts and, in the process, discovered a wonderful symphony of communication we didn't think possible in such a sterility-infested domain as admin settings.

So, dear reader, if you ever find yourself smothering under the weight of myriad email alerts, I invite you to take a leaf from our book. Weave the tapestry of notifications that not only informs but enriches, tailor it to your world and feel the magic when technology bends to our own rhythm—an invitation to embark on a journey, not just to the end, but a beginning.
