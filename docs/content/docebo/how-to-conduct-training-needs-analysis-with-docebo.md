# How to Conduct Training Needs Analysis with Docebo

### The Prelude: The Great Samosa Debacle

Once upon a time, at a software firm that shall remain nameless, we found ourselves in quite the pickle over underperforming customer support. I’m talking a full-blown samosa incident - our euphemism for “let's just cover this with good snacks and hope no one notices.” Our CEO, a man with an uncanny ability to spot a training flaw faster than he could say "samosa," decided it was high time for a revamp. That’s where our journey into the technicolor world of Docebo began.

Ah, Docebo. The name sounds like an opera and rolls off the tongue like good tiramisu. But how does one do a Training Needs Analysis (TNA) in Docebo? Grab a coffee, get comfy - let’s dive into this delightful concoction.

## Step 1: Comprehend the Call of the Wild

Our wild journey requires first capturing the cries of your work ecosystem. **Why do we need training?** Is it because Bob from accounting thinks a pivot table is a new-age dance move? We need a precise understanding - a clear why - before stepping into the realm of Docebo. Conduct informal chats, surveys, even casual eavesdropping, to gather these insights. Greatest shifts often birth from the tiniest whispers. Listen for them, they're key.

## Step 2: Map the Terrain with Analytics

We quickly learned that data doesn’t lie - unlike Steve’s vacation photos. Docebo's analytics feature became our new best friend. Head to the Dashboard from your Docebo homepage. You’ll want to click on ‘Reports’ like you’re opening a treasure chest. 

Here’s where the magic happens:
- **User Reports**: Choose this when you want to delve into individual performances.
- **Course Reports**: This shows you which content is resonating and which could use a little... shall we say, ‘spice’?

Key metrics to watch: completion rates, assessment scores, and course engagement. If everyone is getting stuck mid-way through Module 2, the treasure map may be leading them astray. Time to recalibrate.

## Step 3: Assemble Your Questing Heroes

Remember when we mentioned the CEO and his samosa side quest? Now is the time to gather your own band of merry conspirators. Who needs to be involved in the analysis? Line managers, HR personnel, and a dash of IT support create a stellar team. Not quite the Avengers, but they’ll do.

Navigating Docebo is collaborative. As they say, “there’s no ‘I’ in Docebo,” though admittedly that doesn’t quite hold. 

## Step 4: Craft the Blueprint - Define the Skills and Gaps

With your crew assembled and insights collated, it’s time to sketch a road map. Define what skills are needed using Docebo’s Skills & Certifications module. Are we looking for mastery in cloud computing or perhaps an artful blend of communication skills? 

Go ahead, dive into the ‘Manage Skills and Certifications’ section. Here’s where your journey becomes very **cerebral**:
- Click on ‘Add Skills’ to define the dream competencies.
- Utilize ‘Skills Gap Analysis’ to highlight grand canyons-sized learning gaps.

Compare what you’ve found with the reality check of existing skills. Revel in the moment of clarity this brings. 

## Step 5: Plot Your Learning Adventure

What marvels await on the horizon of learning? Time to translate gaps into action plans by creating courses and paths in Docebo. The ‘Course Management’ section is where you build the curriculum castle.

- **Course Menu**: The layout of our curriculum kingdom. Create courses via ‘New Course’ and embed a mix of media - videos, quizzes, interactive PDFs.
- **Learning Plans**: This long-game strategy will keep learners on their toes. Assemble courses in a sequence that’s both challenging and coherent.

Throughout these, we discovered it’s beneficial to keep options open - variety is the spice of Docebo, after all. Personalize paths with targeted training for different departmental needs. And let’s not forget to inject some soul - even if your content is technical. Remember the power of storytelling.

## Step 6: Set Sail and Gather Feedback

Remember back when we thought training was just a ‘set it and forget it’ affair like some digital oven? Oh, how naive we were. Use Docebo’s social learning features (thank you, forums and blogs) to gather ongoing input.

Release your crafted courses into the wild. Monitor, adjust, and sail forth based on feedback. Engage users - post-launch polls and colorful feedback sessions are your friends here. Ensure the curriculum doesn’t stagnate like last week’s leftovers.

## Step 7: Reflect – Aha Moments

And just like that, you’ve danced the Docebo waltz through a successful TNA. Does everyone still think of it as “training”? Spoiler alert: no. It’s a dynamic voyage, continuously honed and evolving.

Reflect on what worked and where you stumbled, and recount the tales at the proverbial water cooler or in Zoom breakout rooms. Did Bob finally learn his pivot tables? Is Steve’s grammar no longer the stuff of legend?

Remember, conducting a Training Needs Analysis with Docebo is much like throwing a party that never ends – always more to tweak, change, and improve. Keep returning to the why, converse with the Bobs, and adjust the sails.

### The Happy Ever After

So there we were, back on the office battlefield, munching on chocolate samosas - because some traditions are worth keeping - as our teams worked seamlessly in their newly improved learning culture. We’d found the path, paved with data insights, a little creativity, a lot of teamwork, and more than a few double espressos.

That day wasn’t just an ordinary day. We transformed an experience - and isn't that what good training should do? Here's to the journey ahead.
