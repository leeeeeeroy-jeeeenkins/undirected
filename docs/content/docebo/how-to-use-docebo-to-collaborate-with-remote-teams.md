# How to Use Docebo to Collaborate with Remote Teams

_"Remember that time you thought it would be easy?"_ Jim had said, his laugh filling the room over our cobbled-together Zoom call. We were both knee-deep in spreadsheets, trying to align our remote teams spread across three continents. Things felt chaotic. Context was everything, yet seemed perpetually out of reach. It was the promise of collaboration tools like Docebo that made us daydream — maybe, just maybe, there was a better way.

We didn't just want to survive as a remote team; we wanted to thrive with unanticipated efficiency. And so, with a cup of coffee in one hand and hope in the other, we plunged into the world of Docebo. Here's how we wrestled its complexity into something beautifully collaborative.

## Setting the Stage

**To paint or not to paint?** That seemed the question every morning. Before Docebo, our interactions with one another felt like performative art — broad, sweeping gesture that lacked precise detail. But Docebo, as we discovered, wasn't just a blank canvas; it was the whole studio. 

1. **Beginning the Adventure**: First thing’s first, creating an account in Docebo. You'll start here: goto `www.docebo.com`, hover over 'Try Docebo,' and hand over your email like a trusty ticket of passage. Confirm your identity via email and voila – you’re in.

2. **Orientation? Sort of**: Once you've signed up, a dashboard crammed with as many options as there are sprinkles on a cupcake greets you. Feel free to navigate around — there's no wrong turn. However, remember to _locate the compass_ — the ‘Admin Menu’ might as well have a marquee on its head.

This initial exploration phase is all about feeling your way around. With time, you may even come to love its quirks.

## Gathering the Team

Jim wore his 'it's-5-AM-somewhere' face when we first started to onboard the team. Gathering a remote group on any platform is like herding cats and armadillos, each with its own tempo. But with a bit of practice (and sneakily noted in-house tips), we arrived at the game plan.

1. **Team Meets Platform**: Under the Admin Menu, choose 'Users'. There you have it — your control center for adding team members. Click 'Add’, then input their details like some secret cipher. Once added, they’ll receive a note for entry – they're now under your wing in the Docebo realm.

2. **Roles Everyone, Take Your Places!**: Docebo loves a good role play. Underneath that cheeky 'Users' section, lurks 'Profiles & Roles'. Here, you can assign who gets to be the King of the Kingdom or the Jester — or you know, adjust permissions based on job roles. Be generous, be cautious, but most importantly — be adventurous.

3. **Building Bridges with Teams**: Now to glue it all together. Click on 'Groups', and start piecing them together. Executives can be in one, marketing savants in another. Customization in Docebo is like building with Legos, only you get to define what a spaceship looks like.

## Crafting Courses – Our Grand Experiment

With our ragtag bunch finally in place, it was time to tackle the pièce de résistance — course creation. Like writing a novel but with fewer adverbs, this was where our blend of creativity and organization would shine.

1. **Courses, Craft and Conquer**: Return to your beloved Admin Menu. Go to 'Courses'. Here, you can create new ones by clicking 'Add Course'. Give your course a name, define the type – e-learning, webinar, or classroom. This is your magnum opus.

2. **Content, Against the Current**: Jim and I pulled late-night marathons uploading content. Go into your newly-minted course, click 'Training Material'. Drag and drop goodies – PDFs, videos, audio files. We even came up with quizzes, though not nearly as fun as pub trivia nights. Yet they were mighty effective.

3. **Formal Learning Structures**: Structured learning paths are our nod to tradition. You can string multiple courses together. Like beads on a bracelet, they guide the learner's journey. Under 'Learning Plans' in 'Admin Menu', daisy-chain those courses until they hum with synergy.

## Cultivating Communication

In our quest for seamlessness, we discovered something ironic: more than coordination, communication saved our metaphorical bacon. Talking is easy, but real communication is an art.

1. **Discussion Forums – Virtual Campfires**: We introduced forums nestling under our course tabs. Choose 'Manage' and then 'Discussions' — likely the pixel equivalent of a circle of trust. There, we debated, shared feedback, and once even launched a meme war that morphed into team bonding.

2. **Scheduling and Synchronicity**: Webinars became our thumping heartbeats. To schedule one, go to your course creation page and bless it with a webinar session. Utilize integration options with Zoom, GoToWebinar, or whatever tickles your fancy.

3. **Dashboards – The Overlords of Progress**: Ah, reports and dashboards. Sounds dull, doesn’t it? Yet, they reveal strides made and paths yet to be ventured. Inside the Admin Menu, under 'Reports', delegates can feast on knowledge. Analyze, iterate, succeed — in that order.

## Keeping the Flame Alive

Once, over an extended Zoom lunch break, we realized how our team camaraderie kept us going. Docebo simply became our medium more than anything else.

1. **Onboarding Flourish**: Capture the spirit of your team with custom onboarding paths. Within 'Learning Plans' — feed team-specific material, prepare tutorials, embed inside jokes. If teams were battalions, this would be their battle hymn.

2. **Innovative Badges and Goals**: Recognize achievements with badges — like kindergarten stickers, but upscale. Head over to the 'Admin Menu', under 'Gamification’. Design your own accolades — lead with humor, stay sincere.

3. **Feedback, In Praise and in Love**: At every step, encourage feedback. Good, bad, neutral, it all widens the horizon. With Docebo’s ‘Surveys’ tool under ‘Reports’, craft questions that widen the lens and illuminate paths yet to walk.

Every so often, we flashback to our first fumbling attempts with Docebo. Now, it feels less like herding cats and more like conducting an overture. Jim still insists on using GIFs for explanations - some habits never change. As remote becomes less an exception and more the norm, tools like Docebo aren't just answers. They become our text, brick and mortar in the storytelling of collaboration. As we peek into this brave new world of remote teams, the journey remains ours to shape, one course at a time.
