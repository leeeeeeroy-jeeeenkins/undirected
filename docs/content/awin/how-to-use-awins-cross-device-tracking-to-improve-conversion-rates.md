# How to Use Awin's Cross Device Tracking to Improve Conversion Rates

You know those moments when the world just clicks, like when your jigsaw puzzle aligns perfectly after hours of struggle or when you find something you didn't know you were missing? There was this particular Tuesday afternoon, not unlike any other, except for one detail: our conversion rates were stuck in molasses — slow, sticky, and not very sweet. It's like trying to squeeze toothpaste from an empty tube; in a word, frustrating. Jane from accounting swore it was a cosmic punishment for stealing her last jelly donut, but the truth was it had something to do with our cross-device tracking, or the lack thereof. Enter Awin's Cross Device Tracking — our new beacon of hope.

Awin, the hero we've stumbled upon while sipping lukewarm office coffee, offers this magical tool that allows us to track conversions across multiple devices. Trust me, once you start using it, you won't want to stop. But first, let's walk through the labyrinth of integration, understanding, and fine-tuning this marvel to morph our sluggish sales into a veritable powerhouse of wallet-busting goodness.

## The Eureka Moment — Understanding Cross Device Tracking

Back in those hazy days before our conversion epiphany, I was entirely ignorant of how people flit about their gadgets like caffeinated hummingbirds — starting on a phone, perhaps a visit from a laptop, finalizing on a tablet. Devices are their worlds. Imagine our audience hopping across these worlds!

Cross Device Tracking identifies these trailblazers, piecing together their journey like Sherlock Holmes on a caffeine high. Awin does this by using a mix of deterministic and probabilistic methods to match data points, track our cookieless wanderers, and transform their digital footprints into plain sight.

### Deterministic vs. Probabilistic — Not a War, but a Dance

I recall a conversation with Tim from the tech team. "It's like dating," he said. “Deterministic is when you have a confirmed match — trust, security, a love story. Probabilistic is more like speed dating — quick assessments leading to educated guesses.” Awin smartly combines these, giving us the best of both worlds without the awkward post-date ghosting. But let's get into specifics.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using Awin’s Cross Device Tracking

Let's crank this up — grab a cup of coffee, a trusty notebook, and maybe a donut (not Jane’s), ‘cause we’re going full throttle now.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Awin Advertiser Account

Remember signing up for an online newsletter, simpler, really. Your journey with Awin starts here. Create an account through their platform. Follow the prompts, plug in your details, the hassle sweat-free, almost zen-like.

### Step 2: Integrating Tracking Tags 

Here’s a bit of sorcery — weaving Awin’s tags into the fabric of your site. A moment recalled from our past fiasco: be wary of those broken codes, a semicolon can be quite the nemesis. Implement JavaScript tags or server-to-server tracking using simple code snippets. These tags are the surveillance that never sleeps, like a vigilant owl hooting away silently.

```

### Step 3: Deploy Device Graph Data

Deploy, sounds like you’re launching spaceships but in truth, it’s more drawing a sketch. Awin’s device graph is like the world’s most efficient game of connect-the-dots. Activate this within your dashboard — grab a newbie or reigning tech genius for navigation guidance. Monitor, adjust, recalibrate. It’s part art, part math.

### Step 4: Optimize, Optimism Not Included 

Testing, tweaking, more testing — sounds mundane, but remember, the devil's in the details. Reassess traffic flows, conversion paths, and customer experiences with an eye overflowing with scrutiny. We've had fits of joy and exasperation doing this, I kid you not. Once we optimized, watching those numbers shoot up was like seeing fireworks, a grand celebration of number-driven narrative arcs.

## Anne from Marketing and Wisdom in Metrics

Anne, our go-to marketing maven, says metrics are the pulse of the campaign (with the seriousness she usually reserves for rooting for her team on game nights). Monitor these with zeal; they're like breadcrumbs leading to profitable wonderland.

### Analytics Platforms Integration

A quick pit stop here. Marry your analytics platforms - Google Analytics, Piwik, Adobe Analytics - with Awin for seamless start-to-finish tracking. This integration ensures you aren’t tripping over data silos in the dark like a midnight snack run gone wrong.

## Creativity and Cunning — Customize Campaigns

Question: What did our sustained increase in conversions have in common? Creativity. Amp up appeal with customized, personalized campaigns. Use device tracking insights to cultivate content that speaks directly to your patrons’ souls — or at least metaphorically tap dances at the intersection of delight and intrigue.

## Reaping the Joys — All is Fair in Love and Conversions

In conclusion, invoking Awin’s Cross Device Tracking brought a sense of peace, much like balancing perfectly on a yoga mat, post-headstand. I won’t say we turned into conversion conjurers overnight, but tracking informed decisions felt less like shooting in the dark. There’s triumph in calculated moves, especially when they lead us to the nirvana of improved conversion rates. We've laughed at the missteps, cheered the little victories, learned, and ultimately evolved — together.
