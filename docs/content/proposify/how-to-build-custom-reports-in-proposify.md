# How to Build Custom Reports in Proposify

It all started on a dreary Tuesday morning when Janine from accounting burst into the meeting room with a quest in her eyes. "We need custom reports," she declared, wielding her spreadsheet like a sword. Now, if you’ve met Janine, you'd know that when she sets her mind on something, it’s best to just nod along and figure it out afterward. Her fervor for personalized data was contagious, and thus began our deep dive into the world of Proposify custom reports.

Building custom reports in Proposify is like baking a cake, the kind that requires a bit more than just eggs and flour. It's all about adding the right sprinkles of data to craft something everyone wants to sink their teeth into. We learned quickly, through trial and error—and spilling a cup of coffee on the keyboard (thanks, Tom!)—that understanding Proposify’s nooks and crannies was crucial. 

## Discovering the Dashboard

First things first. We logged into Proposify, that magical space where proposals come to life and go on to hopefully dazzle clients. The dashboard greeted us with those friendly notifications we often ignore, but this time we knew we were on a mission. Navigating to the Reports section felt like stepping into a new universe of possibility.

The Reports Dashboard is the heart of our data-dreams—where numbers dance and graphs sing. We realized that this enchanted section would become our best friend, a confidant of sorts. Here, Proposify allows us to access its hidden gems: the premade reports. 

### Crafting the Basics

Within this dashboard, we encountered options galore. But like a kid in a candy store, we had to prioritize. We started small, choosing an existing report type to customize. It's like choosing a template for a greeting card—you want something with a strong foundation, yet open to personal flair. To do this, we:

1. **Clicked on “Reports”** from the main dashboard to reveal a variety of potential masterpieces.
2. **Selected "Proposal Reports.”** This particular section offers a medley of report types showcasing proposal status, wins/losses, and more.
3. **Picked a specific report type**—like “Proposal Performance”—to modify to our heart's content.

With our report selected, the canvas was set for our creative input. This is where Proposify's flexibility shone.

### Tweaking and Tuning

Ah, the joy of tinkering! We felt like explorers mapping uncharted lands as we began adjusting filters and data sets. It was during this part of the process that we realized the importance of knowing exactly what we wanted. Precision, like Janine’s attention to detail, would guide us. We decided to:

- **Adjust Filters:** This was crucial. We could narrow down data by date range, by team member, or even by proposal stage. Like customizing your favorite ice cream cone, each choice altered the flavor of our report.
- **Select Columns:** Proposify allows us to cherry-pick which data columns to include. It’s akin to choosing toppings—does one ever really need olives on pizza? No.
- **Sort and Arrange:** We were given the power to rearrange our data like deck chairs on the Titanic—hopefully with far better results.

### Saving the Masterpiece

After what seemed like hours (but was just thirty minutes because we've got skills), our report was ready. It felt like naming a newly adopted pet, deciding what this creation would be called. We saved our custom report with a name that would spark joy every time we saw it—"Janine's Supreme Report Experience."

Hitting “Save” on Proposify was like sealing a letter to Hogwarts; it felt momentous. And just like that, our report was neatly tucked away, ready to be summoned whenever Janine chose to wave her digital wand. 

## Sharing the Glory

Crafting custom reports isn’t merely a solitary triumph; it’s an opportunity to share our hard-won data goodies with the entire team. Proposify makes sharing as simple as sipping lemonade on a summer day. We gathered everyone around, and here’s how we spread the love:

1. **Exported the Report:** Proposify lets us export reports in several formats. PDF, CSV—like a multifunctional Swiss army knife. We chose the format that best suited Janine's analytical palate.
   
2. **Sent the Report:** With hearts full of anticipation, we emailed the report to the team. Like sending invitations to a digital banquet, we awaited feedback. Spoiler: It was positive.

3. **Set Permissions:** Sharing is caring but also demands boundary setting. We configured who could view or edit the report. It’s about keeping the dance floor spacious yet exclusive.

## Reflecting on the Experience

Sitting down with steaming mugs of cocoa—because we earned it—we reflected on this journey with a sense of achievement. Building custom reports in Proposify became more than a task; it was a chance to understand our data in a way that truly mattered. We gleaned some insights on teamwork, ingenuity, and the necessity of good naming conventions.

Janine, with her precise eyes, was pleased, and we all knew that Proposify had become a touchstone in our workflow. It wasn’t just about numbers; it was about what those numbers signified. Every proposal carries a story, and now, thanks to our custom reports, we could tell it with confidence and flair.

Building these reports encouraged us to look beyond the basics, to challenge those set boundaries, and to embrace creativity. It was a little daunting at first, like the first day of school, but it ultimately fostered something beautiful—a fresh, exciting dynamic in how we handle proposals. 

## Conclusion: A Journey in Mastery

And thus, our Proposify adventure concluded, not with a bang, but with the comforting hum of a job well done. This isn't just about constructing reports; it’s about breaking down barriers, stepping beyond the ordinary, and finding joy in the unexpected.

Creating custom reports in Proposify wasn’t simply a task or an objective to tick off the list—it felt more like planting a garden that blossoms over time. Or maybe, more aptly, like cooking a stew where each element, each spice, added a new layer of flavor to our data dish.

Janine returned to the room later with a gentle nod, the kind that said, "Good job, everyone," but more eloquently because no words were needed. And in that moment, tucked away in our snug office corner, we felt like genuine magicians of data, crafting stories out of statistics—wizards in the realm of reports. 

We remain ever in awe of Proposify’s charm: so simple, yet so deep. Just like good friendships and warm croissants.
