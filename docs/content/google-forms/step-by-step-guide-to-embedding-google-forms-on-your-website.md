# Step by Step Guide to Embedding Google Forms on Your Website

With an old espresso machine whirring in the corner, reminding us of past all-nighters fueled by caffeine and good intentions, we sat down at the kitchen table—the heart of all our cozy plotting sessions. Hemmingway once said to write drunk and edit sober, and though we weren’t exactly drunk, we were definitely tipsy on the thrill of innovating our disheveled website. There’s something magical about the simplicity of a Google Form, isn’t there? It’s like that friend who always writes everything down and keeps the group on track. Embedding it on our website, however, sounded about as exciting as organizing a sock drawer.

But alas, necessity is the mother of invention, and we needed some feedback from our devoted blog readers—a surprisingly opinionated tribe. We gathered, laptops and a shared determination in hand, ready to discover the hidden secrets of making Google Forms dance across our webpage like a disciplined ballet company. Join us on this journey, and perhaps by the end, you’ll have bonded with your own kitchen table in a similar way.

### **Step 1: Creating the Google Form**

Oh, the thrill of creation! Opening Google Forms is like diving into an ocean full of possibilities—or at least a decent-sized swimming pool, where we can paddle along the water's surface comfortably. Just as Carly once suggested a spontaneous road trip to the middle of nowhere, we decided to keep things simple and intuitive. After all, ease is key when you’re just setting sail on the vast sea of embedding forms.

1. Head over to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com). The familiar rainbow G beckons like an old friend inviting you over for tea.
   
2. Click on the `+ Blank` option to sprout a new form or choose a template—like deciding between a blank canvas or a painting-by-numbers kit.

3. Title your form. Ours was the digital equivalent of "Tell Us What's Wrong with Us!" It's both charming and disarming.

4. Add your questions. Multiple choices, short answers, a lyrical essay; the choice is yours! Make each selection like you’re choosing the perfect avocado at the store (it’s all in the feeling).

### **Step 2: Acquiring the Embed Code**

The next step was akin to capturing fireflies on a hot summer night. Simple in theory but often requiring a touch of finesse. It felt momentous—a bit like discovering our favorite diner had added a new menu item that instantly became "the usual."

1. Finish your form with all the aplomb of a show finale, then click the `Send` button at the top right. A feeling of anticipation flutters in your stomach as if you’re stashing away a secret recipe.

2. Choose the `</>` option, the grand symbol of embed, as recognizable as an old friend across a crowded room.

3. You’ll see an `Embed HTML` code. Copy it. Press `Command + C` or `Ctrl + C`—depending on whether you’re an Apple devotee or a Windows wizard. The code is now firmly in your digital grasp, ready for its grand debut on the stage of the worldwide web.

### **Step 3: Embedding the Form on Your Website**

The plot thickens! Here, the code becomes a living part of your website—much like introducing an eccentric character into your Sunday book club. It can be intimidating, but isn't anything worth doing a little scary?

1. Open your website editor. Whether it’s WordPress, Squarespace, or—you wild child—even hand-coded HTML, we salute your brave heart!

2. Locate the part where you wish your form to appear. We chose a spot like picking seats in a movie theater—right in the middle for maximum impact.

3. Startle your inner tech wizard by switching to HTML mode. It’s that moment in the movie where the protagonist realizes they’ve had the power all along.

4. Paste the code. Command + V or Ctrl + V, and voila, your Google Form is now harmonizing with your website’s design.

5. Save your changes. You wouldn’t leave the house without locking the door, and this step ensures that all your hard work stays put.

### **Step 4: Testing the Form**

Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game—and never forget to test our shiny new form. Testing is like the encore to a rock concert. Crucial and celebratory.

1. Visit your website—preferably in incognito mode. We did this with as much anticipation as opening the oven to check if the cookies were ready.

2. Fill out the form. Check for glitches, typos, or the dreadfully inelegant question phrasing. It’s the ol' taste test before serving the meal.

3. Submit. Is everything functioning smoothly? You're akin to a maestro commanding an orchestra.

4. If something's amiss, return to your workspace, tinker, adjust, and attempt again—a little like trying to get your espresso machine to understand that 6 AM is not the time for malfunctions.

### **Step 5: Sharing the Form**

In the digital age, what's a form if it isn't shared? Imagine a party with no invitations sent—that's a lonely sidebar on a website.

1. Send invitations. Social media, emails, a nondescript note on a bulletin board—the world is your oyster, and your form is the pearl waiting to be discovered.

2. Monitor responses. Google Forms lets you do this with graphs, summaries, and charts that would make any statisticians proud.

3. Adjust accordingly. Feedback is gold, so use it to polish your website like it’s a vintage car mirror.

As we sat back down, our heads fizzing with both caffeine and the giddy realization we actually did it—well, mostly—it dawned on us. Technology doesn’t have to be impersonal. It can be as warm and welcoming as a kitchen table crowded with friends, old espresso stains slightly darkening its surface, as we marvel at the universe through the lens of a simple Google Form.

And that, dear reader, is how we made Google Forms our new best friend.
