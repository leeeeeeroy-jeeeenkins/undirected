# Creating Accessible Events Using Cvent

Ah, planning events—an experience akin to meticulously arranging a live-action game of Jenga. You build, pray nothing falls apart, and hope everyone leaves feeling grand. I remember vividly my first foray into the chaotic world of event planning. There I was, wide-eyed with a list of things we could barely afford and a venue more labyrinthine than our schedule. But we were excited. Excitement is an understatement. We were thrilled. But one thing struck us quite early on, something that should have been as natural as breathing—it had to be accessible for everyone, including a group of friends who relied on wheelchairs and screen readers. Enter Cvent, our unexpected hero.

## Understanding the Necessity & Cvent's Role 

We didn't just want an event that people with disabilities could also attend; it needed to be an event where everyone felt at home. We often hear "be inclusive," but let's admit it—those two words are about as useful as a dental appointment reminder when you don't have a dentist. As we waded through the plethora of tools, policies, and aspirations, Cvent came out gleaming—or maybe more accurately, it stuck out because it didn't require us to sacrifice our sanity.

This virtual platform, Cvent, it seemed, held the key to that enchanted land where the grassroots and the grand plans effortlessly coalesce. It’s not just about ticketing or check-ins; it covered little details like accessibility, making it inclusive right from the onset. Curious, we dived deeper.

### Setting Up an Accessible Event in Cvent

During our dive into the Cvent world, creating accessible events became less of a trial and error circus and more of a step-by-step journey. Let’s walk through the missteps, victories, and revelations together.

#### 1. Custom Registrations for All

Registration—it's the starting point, where attendees feel the excitement build or sense dread if they get lost in a sea of bad UX. Our adventure began with setting up custom registration forms. In Cvent, we found we could implement custom questions that subtly inquired about specific accessibility needs. 

**Step 1:** Open Cvent's platform. Navigate to **Event > Registration > Create New Registration**.

**Step 2:** Click on **Add Custom Questions**. Create a question along the lines of "Do you have any specific accessibility needs?"

This tiny question turns a nametag operation into an empathetic welcoming.

#### 2. Venue & Web Accessibility

In our envy of past self who thought choosing a venue was a walk in the park (spoiler: it’s more like a trudge up Everest), we realized venue accessibility was a non-negotiable. Cvent offered a checklist for this madness.

Under **Event Details**, we listed our venue’s accessibility features, that included ramps, hearing loops, or sign language interpreters. 

**Step 3:** Go to **Settings > Accessibility Information** to update these details.

#### 3. Communication That Speaks Volumes

The emails, reminders, and possibly even spam (just a little) which often bombard your inbox are the lifelines of any event. These should be clear, not the cryptic prose of ancient wizards. Cvent offers templates, where you can ensure text is accessible and readable by screen readers.

**Step 4:** Create a template using the accessibility options under **Email > Create New Template**. Stick to simple fonts and avoid the temptation of a rainbow color palette—your attendees will thank you.

### Tingle of Excitement: Integrating Technology with Human Touch

Remember Claire? She was part of our planning brigade—a tech enthusiast, always in her element with her gadgets. But it was her disability insights that challenged us to push the accessibility envelope. Cvent allowed Claire to add accessibility features to our virtual elements too. Options for closed captions during webinars, providing ASL interpreters, and using alt-tag descriptions for images adorned our checklist.

#### 4. Tech Savvy Yet Humble

With Claire leading the charge on our virtual event terrain, Cvent seamlessly integrated closed captioning. Let’s be honest, during these times when we have a trillion tabs open, we needed technology to play nice.

**Step 5:** In **Virtual Event Details**, choose **Settings > Closed Captioning**. Activating it was simpler than watching a cat video.

The long and short of it? Not only did we give attendees audio-visual delight, but we allowed them to focus on participation versus troubleshooting tech issues like accidental mime.

### Feedback & Future Plans: The Symphony of Insights

The event danced along with slight hiccups but mostly applause. And as we heaved a little sigh of relief, understanding set in—the narrative doesn’t end here. Feedback is indeed the bumpy route back home, where you learn the sweet spots and avoid future pitfalls. 

Surveys conducted via Cvent, again with the touch of personalization, offered insights rawer than reality TV—to steer the ship better next time.

**Step 6:** To collect feedback, use **Surveys > New Survey**. Essentials: Keep questions direct, use a likable tone, mean what you ask.

### Conclusion: The Joy of Lifetime Events

So, my friends, this is where our quirky attempt to craft an accessible experience led us. Cvent might not do everything but it certainly does a lot. It gave us tools to ensure everyone, no matter their needs, was part of our storytelling. Through the rollercoaster of planning jitters, we realized it wasn't merely about gathering a crowd—it was about fostering belonging, in ways large and small. 

In our shared quest for more accessible—nay, more human—events, we discovered joy, surprise, and a little bit of humor along the way. Maybe, just maybe, events crafted with love and mindfulness can whisper the kind of stories that linger long after the last chair has been stacked.
