# How to Develop Event Sponsorship Packages Using Cvent

It was a sunlit afternoon when I first stumbled into the concept of event sponsorship. There I was, balancing my coffee and notes, like a clumsy juggler, trying to make my little community event a hit. Amid the chaos, our friend Bob waltzed in with an idea — sponsorship. “You gotta have sponsors!” he exclaimed, his eyes alight with the fervor of an evangelist. I skeptically asked, “But how?” “Ah,” he replied, throwing the weight of the world on a single phrase, “that’s where you figure it out.” Fast forward to today, with Cvent in our toolkit, sponsorship packaging feels less like a Herculean task and more like sharing a map for shared adventures.

### Getting Started with Cvent

Remember the first time you signed into a new software and realized, "What fresh alien language is this?" Well, Cvent is refreshingly intuitive. It’s like they designed it for people who accidentally delete things — something I excel in. First, we log in, a small victory in itself. Take a moment to savor it. Once in, glance at the dashboard; it’s chock-full of all the good stuff. Tabs and buttons gleam under the promise they hold. But we’re heading to the big kahuna: the ‘Event’ section.

- **Step 1:** Click on ‘Events’ from the dashboard. It’ll feel like opening a treasure chest.
- **Step 2:** Select ‘Create Event.’ You’re officially in explorer mode.

Every time we reach this point, I recall that time when Sheila tried setting up her email and invented three new curse words not fit for polite company. With Cvent, thankfully, frustration is minimal.

### Mapping Out Sponsorship Levels

Remember crafting a package that made Bob wonder if there was a typo because it was "too good"? Ah, those were the rookie days. Now, sponsorship levels are akin to building a house. You start with a solid foundation and pile perks on top until you’ve got a skyscraper.

- **Step 3:** In the setup, look for ‘Sponsorship Packages.' Here, you’ll draft tiers like ‘Bronze,’ ‘Silver,’ ‘Gold,’ and if you’re feeling extravagant, Platinum or Diamond.
  
This part can be as exhilarating as negotiating bedtimes for teenagers. Set perks for each level. Add the name on a banner? Sure. Speaking opportunity? Maybe. An optional private jet tour... okay, maybe not. Humor aside, the key here is value creation. Each level should feel distinct yet worth investing in.

### Utilizing Cvent’s Templates

We’ve all had those moments where originality threatened to suffocate us. Templates, to the rescue! Ever tried to draft a sponsorship package from scratch? Reminds me of trying to bake without a recipe — chaos ensues.

- **Step 4:** Click ‘Templates’ within the sponsorship section. Cvent provides pre-built, flexible templates. Here’s the sweet part; these aren't rigid molds, but more like clay ready to be shaped.

If my memory serves me right, it was during wine o'clock with Erica when we cursed the creative block, wishing templates existed for pie making as well.

### Customizing Sponsorship Goals

Once we pick a template, the magic truly begins. It’s where Bob’s wild ideas find a tether to reality. We adapt the template, customize each level’s offerings, and carve out a narrative that excites potential sponsors. Cvent has this handy field called ‘Sponsor Goals.’ This is where we jot down:

- **Step 5:** Click on ‘Sponsor Goals’ from your selected template and articulate specific outcomes you wish for each sponsor. Are we boosting their brand visibility? Generating leads? Ensuring Bob gets his wish of having them at all event mixers?

This reminds us of Jan, who insisted that personalized thank-you notes were still a thing. She swiftly noted it under ‘Goals,’ and despite our skepticism, it worked like a charm.

### Price Tag: The Art of Valuation

Monetizing sponsorship packages is like attending a children’s birthday party unannounced — it’s awkward, tricky, but crucial. Here, we explore what feels like the wild west of valuation.

- **Step 6:** Navigate to ‘Pricing’ within the sponsorship section and start assigning numbers. Public speaking slot at the event? That’s a premium offer. The sponsor's logo on the keynote backdrop? Extra cherries on top.

We learned this from Tom, who once priced an offer so low we were nearly flooded with sponsors. An unforgettable lesson in supply and demand.

### Drafting Contracts

Contracts might feel like pulling teeth without anesthesia. But Cvent takes us by the hand like a timid dance partner.

- **Step 7:** Head to ‘Contracts’ and begin creating boilerplate agreements. Customize them for each tier and sponsor preferences. Cvent’s contract wizard is surprisingly helpful, almost like it was crafted by magicians who moonlight as lawyers.

Remember that chat with our team where we imagined contracts written in haikus? While poetic, legality was woefully absent. Luckily, Cvent keeps us grounded.

### Marketing the Sponsorship Packages

Crafting sponsorship packages is 20% creation, 80% marketing — because what good is a great package if it gathers digital dust?

- **Step 8:** Use Cvent’s ‘Marketing’ tools to blast those carefully curated packages to potential sponsors. Design emails and set campaigns in motion like a maestro conducting a small orchestra.

We chuckled at John’s suggestion to add cat memes to attract sponsors. “Kitten calendars,” he proposed, but wisely, we settled on snazzy video pitches instead. Surprisingly fun, and effective!

### Building the Relationship

Sponsorship isn’t just a one-off transaction. It’s a piece of an ongoing conversation.

- **Step 9:** Lean into Cvent’s CRM tools to maintain constant dialog with sponsors. Send updates, and genuinely take interest (beyond event day!) in their goals and needs. Personal emails or a quick phone call go a long way.

Flashback to the time we hilariously mispronounced a sponsor's name in a closed meeting — bordering on disastrous yet later becoming an endearing joke that turned into camaraderie. A good reminder of the human side to our puzzle of planning.

### Measuring Success

Post-event reflections are like looking back at a collection of home videos — that awkward dance, the great speeches, moments immortalized.

- **Step 10:** Dive into Cvent’s analytics and feedback tools. See what resonated, what sponsors loved, and the areas to refine. This data is gold — a beacon for future endeavors.

We had a sip of celebratory coffee, recalling the extent of Bob’s original skepticism turned partners' delight, all navigated through tools like Cvent.

### Final Thoughts

Wrapping it all up with Cvent feels like reminiscing with friends over a bonfire — savoring the journey from anxiety to achievement. The software is our co-pilot in sponsorship packaging, keeping the unseen forces of disorganization and confusion at bay. Sponsorships are more than transactions; they are partnerships forged with shared dreams and journey maps in hand.

From our clumsy beginnings to polished professionals, Cvent offers us a glimpse of how technology smoothens the raw edges of human endeavor. May your sponsorship ventures be as rewarding as our journey, dear reader. And remember, if you ever find Bob around, offer him a thank-you note – Jan style.
