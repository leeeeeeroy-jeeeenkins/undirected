# How to Get Vimeo Staff Picks for Your Videos

Let me take you back to a moment not so long ago, when a blustery wind and a bad cappuccino led me to a dimly lit coffee shop—one of those places replete with brooding artists and baristas who seem to belong in a Woody Allen film. With the onset of a caffeine-induced epiphany, an idea was born: How could we—mere mortals with cameras—tag our videos with that elusive internet badge of honor, the Vimeo Staff Pick? My initial attempts were, let’s say, educational. Whimsical dances with failures lined the path. Still, I held on to that cappuccino!

## Finding Your Unique Story

Fast forward to a humbling, messy, thoroughly triumphant moment: I realized every video needs that unique voice—a nugget of gold amidst the bedlam of pixels. Remember Sarah, the artist I met in the coffee shop? The one whose art was all about depicting "the untold stories of umbrellas in the rain"? She was my spirit guide. Our first task was to dig deep into our internal archives to unearth our story, to find that peculiar angle that distinguishes our videos from the endless sea of sameness.

Think of your story as the soul of your video. It's like that quirky hat you decided to wear—it may not match every outfit, but boy, does it make you stand out at the party. Whatever your story, let it bleed through every scene. And as all great storytellers know, don’t just *tell* the story—live it, breathe it, make it stampede through the screen until it nudges the viewer's heart.

## Crafting Visually Stunning Content

Now, imagine filming an art gallery with a potato. It’s an absurd thought, but sadly, many start here. We quickly learned - with a high-def sigh - that Vimeo staff have an eye for quality that resembles an eagle spotting a forgotten sandwich from miles away. Investing in good gear —or the next best which may also mean befriending a cinematographer—enables our story to take majestic, soul-stirring flight.

Let’s ponder about Frank. He once used nothing more than sunlight streaming through a colander to create a film about the "Dance of Pasta." It was mesmerizing. Lighting, camera angles, scene composition—all speak a silent language that the trained eyes of Vimeo staff understand exquisitely.

## Originality is Key, but Genuine Connection is the Lock

Before you dive into a Mozart-playing-lawnmower rock opera (or should you?), remember it’s not just about being original for originality's sake. Genuine connection is the secret ingredient. Rachel, an acquaintance whose video about “The Life of Socks” got picked, once told us that sincerity in what you share matters more than the dazzle.

Know your audience, but also know yourself. It’s like that advice we got from our middle school teachers about being true to who we are—albeit more useful. Being true to your vision attracts viewers who can resonate with your art.

## Embrace the Unorthodox and Break Some Rules

We can’t help but channel our inner punk. We got humble with the paint-by-numbers reality of filmmaking and ventured to break the rules. We realized, as Ruby the mechanic once said, “Boundaries are merely suggestions at best.” The old saying about the road less traveled? Turns out, it’s less worn because it’s the road you forge as you go along.

Jean-Michel’s “Neo-Orthodontist Lantern Festival” film—where lanterns ironically addressed dental anomalies—pushed the boundaries of creativity. It’s about embracing the weird, letting the unconventional flirt with structured storytelling just enough to create something beautiful and bizarre.

## Engaging with the Community

Vimeo isn’t merely a platform; it’s a vibrant, pulsating ecosystem of creativity. By interacting, commenting, and generally being the type of person who’d lend a small umbrella in a downpour, you become a known figure in this community. Oliver, who used Vimeo comments like his personal think tank, made invaluable connections that helped polish his film into something the staff couldn’t ignore.

Join groups, partake in challenges, provide insightful feedback—this isn’t just marketing; it’s about being a part of something bigger. Our shared laughter, our collective coffee-driven brainstorms—they matter as much as the final product.

## Understanding Vimeo's Curation Process

We initially approached this like tricking a mythical creature into picking us for a quest. But after much exploration, the path became clearer: Vimeo Staff Picks aren’t chosen by sorcery or rolling dice, but through a meticulous curation process by people who bleed creativity and live for storytelling. Their job is to find narratives that elicit emotion.

Stay updated with what’s being picked, and notice trends, providing insights into what the staff gravitates toward. While our films may not follow trends, they give us the mirror we need to see the potential hidden reflections of our own stories.

## Final Touch: Polishing the Jewel

No great piece of art came without meticulous polishing. Post-production is where we apply those fine brush strokes, from editing to sound design. Remember the subtle impact of Foley artists or the transformative touch plain music notes can have? It’s in the details, the sound of footsteps, the color grading that makes a scene feel like a velvet sunrise.

Do we know Kelsey, the girl whose sound design skills turned a simple ladle landing into a thunderous crescendo? We might not personally, but we certainly admire her craft. Seek that level of diligence.

## Submitting Strategically

Timing is of the essence. You wouldn’t shout your proposal of love into a crowded room when everyone’s looking the other way. Submitting your film when it stands a better chance of being highlighted, when the hive buzzes with anticipation for creativity at the break of day.

Follow the cycles of submissions, observing the history of picks—simple, polite elbow nudges towards what gets noticed.

## Reflect, Practice, and Repeat

Finally, respect the cycle of creation. Sometimes, despite our best efforts, the Vimeo pick remains elusive, and that’s okay. It’s about growth, honing our craft, and finding joy in the journey itself. Sure, Vimeo Staff Picks are an accolade, a nod of recognition, but at the core, it’s about the joy we find in storytelling—and sharing that joy.

Visit upon the moment Lisa shared her journey through multiple angles—discovering hidden gems in each take. Use feedback, learn, adapt, and more than anything, keep creating. Enjoy the whirlwind of creative exploration, let our voices speak louder each time, in this ever-expanding universe of stories ready to unfold.

So, whether at the start of our day with a steaming cup beside us or in the stillness of night where ideas gather like stars, Vimeo awaits our stories. Let us tell them well.
