# 10 Tips for Boosting Productivity with Microsoft Teams

I stood in the middle of our cluttered office last Thursday, a whirlwind of spreadsheets and Post-it notes swirling around me. My colleague, Lisa, sat across the room, eyebrows knitted, trying hopelessly to decode the endless threads of emails we’d all been ignoring. The air was thick with the hum of computers and a rather suspiciously vibrating phone. Things needed to change. Enter Microsoft Teams—a beacon of digital hope in our otherwise analog chaos.

In the spirit of sharing, or mainly because the experience left us slightly better at our jobs, here are ten tips that we've discovered on our journey with Microsoft Teams, to boost—nay, catapult—your productivity to Olympian heights.

## 1. Customizing Your Notification Settings

Remember when notifications were our constant nemesis—the unyielding flood trying to drag us into a sea of distractions? It was like arriving home to seventy-five barking dogs after a long day at work. But with Teams, you can change your notification settings to suit your needs perfectly.

**Step by Step**:
1. Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner of the app.
2. Select `Settings`.
3. Navigate to `Notifications`.
4. Customize notifications by channels, mentions or messages.

That sweet sense of serenity returned as no more were we interrupted mid-task by minor updates. Choose wisely, young grasshopper, and let the pings come only when they truly matter.

## 2. Mastering the Art of Channels

Some days it felt like we were shouting in the dark; all our messages lost amidst tangled threads. Enter the glorious world of channels. Channels are your new best friends—each one a dedicated space for specific projects, themes, or teams.

**Create a Channel**:
1. In the left navigation pane, go to your Team.
2. Click the `...` more options next to the team name.
3. Select `Add Channel`.
4. Name your channel and add a description for context.

We set up channels for everything: Lunch Planning, Dance Off Competitions, and once, preposterously, just for pictures of cats in office attire. Each channel, a universe in itself, saving us from the clutches of clutter.

## 3. Using Tabs to Keep Everything in Sight

It happened one afternoon. We’d been collectively staring at our screens, eyes glazed, searching for a file Lisa insisted she’d uploaded. Turns out, she had. Three weeks prior. That's where tabs came into play—like a guide patiently pointing us to the right cavern.

**How to Add Tabs**:
1. Navigate to the channel.
2. Click on the `+` icon next to tabs at the top.
3. Select the app or document you want to add there.

Bringing files, websites, or apps into view meant no more wild treasure hunts across digital landscapes. Visibility just improved across the board. 

## 4. Scheduling and Starting Meetings like a Pro 

Remember the time Tim couldn’t find the conference room link and joined the meeting 17 minutes late, missing the embarrassing "cat filter" incident entirely? We learned from that—hurray for scheduling and sharing meeting links directly via Teams.

**Scheduling Meetings**:
1. Click on `Calendar` on the left.
2. Click on `New meeting`.
3. Fill out your meeting details and invite attendees.

It’s a wonder how timely appearances have improved ever since. Our meetings now start like clockwork unless, of course, the cat filter rears its pixelated head again.

## 5. Collaborate on Files with Grace

There was a moment—a brief, brilliant moment—where every team member edited the same document simultaneously. It was like synchronized swimming, minus the pool but with the elegance of underwater spreadsheets.

**File Collaboration**:
1. Upload a file by clicking "Files" in your Team.
2. Open with Office Online.
3. Watch the magic happen with everyone working together in real-time.

Our documents now, edited flawlessly, remain intact and bereft of any formatting wars. It’s like a well-rehearsed dance, minus the jazz hands.

## 6. Embracing Integration

It all started with the innocent addition of Trello into our Teams ecosystem. It was chaos, flipping through apps like a deck of cards, until we realized we could bring everything under one exuberant digital tent.

**Add Integrations**:
1. From the left-hand side, select Apps.
2. Search for apps to integrate.
3. Click `Add` and follow prompts.

We've embraced a simple philosophy since then: why go looking for tools when you can have them all in one splendid smorgasbord of functionality?

## 7. Use Activity Insights to Keep in Rhythm

Monday mornings are not exactly a festival of enthusiasm. More like a slow clamber up a hill than a dance party. But with Activity Insights, we began each week on the right beat.

**Check Activity Insights**:
1. Click on `Activity` on the left pane.
2. Review missed mentions, replies, and messages.

Having all updates at a glance is the drumbeat to which our Monday productivity marches. Don’t be left lagging to the rhythm of chaos.

## 8. Exploit Shortcuts and Commands 

We were forever clicking, mouse-twiddling, dragging our way to the things we needed. Until we discovered shortcuts, our fingers limber and ready to dance across the keyboard like seasoned flamenco dancers.

**Key Shortcuts**:
- `Ctrl` + `.` to open all shortcuts list
- `Ctrl` + `E` to search quickly
- `/` for commands like `/files` to find recent files

If only I could remember all of them—but alas, even the gentlest grasp on these could be enlightening.

## 9. Utilizing Focus Time Wisely

Calling it “Focus time” may be inaccurate because we mostly spent it staring into space, brainstorming, and occasionally rethinking our entire life plan. Yet, Teams proved valuable in organizing these existential crises efficiently.

**Set Focus Time**:
1. Click on `Analytics` from the left pane.
2. Select `Focus plan` and set designated times.

Now focus time isn’t just a fanciful notion but a well-scheduled event. It doesn't stop us from daydreaming, but now we daydream with structure.

## 10. Prioritize Your Wellbeing—Balance Work and Life

At one point, Teams became our playground and prison, both. Balancing work and leisure was slipping through our fingers like sand. So, we set boundaries as a team by using status updates to signal our working modes.

**Set Status with Timer**:
1. Click your Profile Picture.
2. Select `Set status message`.
3. Specify your status with timings.

The boardroom seats may still see us adhering late hours; however, with status updates, the blur between personal and professional time has gradually sharpened into focus. Now, we explore worlds outside our screens without guilt.

Microsoft Teams, with its cornucopia of features, didn't just organize our work; it brought whimsy back into it. Exploring its hidden corners is like unlocking levels in a childhood video game—every feature discovered is an increment in our productivity and a source of little joys, shared among us as a team. All said and done, even if Tim still can't log into meetings on time, at least we've made our workspace just a bit more organized, and life, a touch easier.
