# How to Conduct Daily Standups on Microsoft Teams

Ah, the daily standup—I remember the first time we decided to try it out virtually. We were all gathered around our screens sipping lukewarm coffee, attempting to mimic the energy of a once crowded office space. It was an unusual experiment in coordinating the chaos of our human experiences through pixels and code. The virtual realm, far removed from the comforting shuffling of feet and whispered comments. This story begins with that intrepid first experience, which taught me more than I anticipated about how to wrangle a team into effective digital communication. 

## Setting the Stage: Our First Virtual Huddle

When we decided to use Microsoft Teams for our daily standup meetings, it was uncharted territory. A brave new world, if you will. The usual murmur of voices blending into a harmonious hum was replaced by digital delays and—unbeknownst microphone muting. Yet we persevered. There was George with his reliable enthusiasm, who always managed to kick-off the meeting with a smile that reached his eyes—digitally speaking. Bessie had a knack for pulling in stragglers with her enticing updates, which was perfect to keep the team engaged.

### Step 1: Creating a Dedicated Channel

Before we could have these engaging conversations, we needed a home—a digital space just for us. Our sanctuary amidst the bytes and bits. Here’s how to create that sacred place in Microsoft Teams:

1. **Open Microsoft Teams**: Like buying a ticket to our show.
2. **Navigate to 'Teams'**: Use the sidebar to uncover your groups. It’s the treasure map leading you to your teams.
3. **Create a New Team**: Click on 'Join or create a team' and select 'Create team'. This is where you name your collective identity (like "The Dream Makers" or "Bug Slayers").
4. **Create a Channel**: Within your team, hover over the name, click the ellipsis (the three magic dots), and select 'Add channel'. Name it something catchy—"Morning Pow-wow" or "Daily Disco" for some extra flair.

And there we were, holding our first session in a space that smelled of potential—or just the faint waft of strong coffee.

### Step 2: Scheduling the Standup

Ah, but it’s not enough to just have the space; we needed a rhythm, a consistent beat to march to. Here’s how we tethered our schedules to the digital clock:

1. **Go to the Calendar**: Click on the left sidebar—it’s like a time machine that only goes forward.
2. **New Meeting**: Hit 'New meeting' to schedule your rendezvous with destiny.
3. **Fill in the Details**: Enter a meeting title that excites—no one can resist "Daily Celebration" or "The Great Update Extravaganza".
4. **Set the Recurrence**: Make it a daily affair, because there’s beauty in routine—and maybe a bit of chaos when we occasionally forget the mute button.
5. **Send the Invitation**: We included everyone who needed to be in the loop. Adding a fun gif with the invite never hurts.

George loved sending cheeky reminders—“Remember to bring your optimism and a cup of sanity”—and it made us all chuckle before we actually knew what we were chuckling about.

### Step 3: The Meeting Itself

And then, the moment arrived. Our unmistakable foray into conversations laced with insights and tidbits of humor. Here’s how we made the digital space come alive:

1. **Join the Meeting**: Click 'Join' from either the reminder pop-up or the calendar in Teams.
2. **Use Mute Like a Pro**: Begin muted. Only unmute when ready to grace others with your thoughts—the unsung skill of digital meeting etiquette.
3. **Share Video**: If possible, turn on the video. There’s something magical about seeing each other’s faces—even if it’s just to see how creatively disheveled George could look at 9 AM.
4. **Follow the Flow**: We operated on a structure—what we did yesterday, plans for today, and roadblocks. Each of us took turns without interrupting; it was like a well-choreographed dance.

Once I noticed Bessie grinning mid-call. She later shared she’d finally conquered her nemesis—a particularly persistent bug—and we all rejoiced as if we’d scaled Everest together.

### Step 4: Utilize Integrative Features

In our quest to elevate our standups, we unlocked a few extra capabilities within Teams that added a dazzling touch:

1. **Meeting Notes**: We used the 'Meeting notes' feature to keep track of important details—like who suggested the best bug-fix or George’s oddball ideas.
2. **Whiteboard**: Sometimes, when words failed, a drawing sufficed. Scribbling on the integrated whiteboard feature brought expressions to life.
3. **Files and Tabs**: We could link to relevant documents right within the meeting channel. Bessie loved attaching inspirational memes to lighten the mood.

Bessie shared a meme once dissecting our sector’s humor—a revelation in pixels that reminded us why laughter was necessary.

### Step 5: Post-Meeting Rituals

The culmination of our standup dance was always sweetened by a well-rounded conclusion and a little introspection:

1. **Wrap It Up**: We’d conclude promptly to ensure everyone could tackle their to-do list. 
2. **Check-in on Tasks**: As teams do, we’d follow up subtly in chat or through threads to lend a hand—in case someone was drowning in digital paperwork.
3. **Give Feedback**: We learned to speak up for improvements. Some days you just need more cat videos or fewer technical glitches.

George habitually threw out feedback with hilarious analogies that made us forget it was even feedback; it was like the perfect seasoning to our dish.

## Reflections from the Pixels

These daily mosaics of connection taught us more than just productivity. They were our morning coffee replaced by engaging dialogue. Some days, the nuggets shuffled forward with unexpected nuance, and on others, we danced around unpredictable tech glitches with laughter. The journey of maintaining these connections warmed us; our digital realm became one where even small victories felt like a resounding chorus of cheers. Every meeting was a step closer to understanding our collective goal—and each person’s subtle contribution shaped it. Each standup gifted us a beacon—that gentle nudge towards collaboration woven by genuine camaraderie. 

Here's to making your own digital symphony with Microsoft Teams—may your standups be as entertaining as they are productive.
