# Advanced Microsoft Teams Features You Should Be Using

You know those moments when you're sitting there, sipping coffee at a virtual meeting, and suddenly an epiphany hits you—oh, yes, those tech-aholic epiphanies! It was a Tuesday morning—Bob's oddball jokes still ringing in our ears from the usual Monday madness. That's when it happened. Our team was struggling to find the perfect way to manage projects without losing our mind marbles. Then Nancy exclaimed, "Have we ever actually poked around Microsoft Teams?" And thus began our beautiful odyssey—our dive into the digital tongue of Teams.

The more we explored, the more we realized we had been just scratching the surface. Little sparkling gems of features awaited our discovery, slowly unfurling their wonders as a magician reveals hidden cards. We thought we’d share what we learned, infuse it with our small office chaos, and maybe add a pinch of humor and a lot more clarity than we started with.

## Collaboration Beyond Text: Embrace Shared Channels

Picture this: It was like we had just discovered teleportation. Wendy and I had been playing a virtual tug-of-war, forever forwarding emails to our partners. Our inboxes were bulging like suitcases after a shopping spree. And then—the Teams Shared Channels! We cheered aloud, startling the poor cat napping on Bob's desk. Shared Channels are like these magical portals enabling seamless communication beyond the walls of your organization—evoking a sense of unity fit for an inter-office symphony.

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. Navigate to the Teams app and select your team.
2. Click on the **More options** (ellipsis icon) next to the team name.
3. Choose **Add channel**.
4. Fill in a unique channel name and a brief description.
5. Under **Privacy**, select **Shared - People you choose from your org or other orgs**.
6. Hit **Create**, invite stakeholders with unique **channel invitation links**, and voila—peace across realms.

Now Wendy and her partners play catch with ideas rather than emails, leaving room for espresso talk breaks and cat therapy.

## Meetings? Pfft—Present Virtually with Class

Remember when Janet mega-morphed into a PowerPoint Picasso overnight? It was the virtual gallery we've all dreamt of. Microsoft Teams allows you to glam up your presentations with nifty options that warrant a standing ovation—or, at least, a good office round of applause.

You have a few tricks up your sleeve if you wish to play the virtuoso:

1. In a meeting, click the **Share content** button (the upward arrow bolt).
2. Select **PowerPoint Live** to really live with your presentation.
3. Choose a file from OneDrive or upload your own masterwork.
4. Participants can scroll through the slide deck at their leisure, while you—the artist—conduct the live showcase.

We were floored by the creative flairs, and honestly, Janet's interactive charts got us thinking about opening an art bar gallery—where digital dreams meet real beverages.

## To-Do Lists Done Right with Task Lists

Ah, the endless to-do lists. Sticky notes stuck everywhere stealing your sanity. Enter Microsoft Teams—Mark's ultimate savior. Fueled by a sudden dalliance with organization (and too much coffee), Mark stumbled upon the Task Lists. A revelation on par with discovering that you put on mismatched socks—it gives you clarity, and then, it makes you laugh a little.

To weave your own tapestry of productivity drama:

1. In the Teams app, find Tasks by Planner and To-Do, literally under **More added apps**.
2. Humbly name your task list and click **Add task** to note your brainwaves.
3. Allocate deadlines, priorities, and color-coding worthy of a 90s hacker movie.
4. Tick off your completed tasks; there’s something so satisfying about that check mark... it populates a beautiful list of accomplishments, leaving you reveling in satisfaction.

Now Mark's only grievance is how fast he runs out of things on his list!

## Crafting Unique Identities Through Custom Backgrounds

We’ve all had that moment—Phil’s kitchen backsplash, though a modern marvel in earth tones, wasn't exactly Board Room Chic for our clients. A plethora of pre-installed wallpapers later, Teams graciously offered us the chance to wear our personality loud and proud.

Add a pop of personal pizzazz by doing this:

1. Initiate or join a Teams meeting.
2. Click the **More actions** (ellipsis icon) and then **Apply background effects**.
3. Choose from existing backgrounds or click **Add new** to upload your image file—perhaps that ideal Polynesian beach awaits?
4. Click **Apply and preview** to check your new look.

Since then, Phil's now the beach guru, sporting virtual palm trees behind his serious spreadsheets.

## Secure and Share with Sensational File Management

Let's talk files. Remember when Cathy couldn't find the 'game-changer' document, and it ended up in Tom's recycling? With Microsoft Teams, you get to sidestep such peril. It's an eccentric yet endearing way to handle files—peace of document mind.

Dive into this organizational wonderland as such:

1. Open the Teams app and choose the team with the file of interest.
2. Navigate to the **Files** tab to access a treasure trove of folders and unique file pathways.
3. Click **New** or **Upload** to add luminary digital papers that change project course.
4. Sync those files to your desktop using OneDrive, for no-hassle, on-demand access to your project jewels.

Gone are the days of wandering through digital haystacks; now Cathy and Tom host folder landmarks like pros.

As our cozy band of office warriors learned and laughed, we discovered that embracing these Teams features injected a fresh verve into our workdays. Our shenanigans graced by a slew of sweet discoveries. Each click led us further into the wonderland, escaping the mundane rhythm of “Open, Close, Sleep, Repeat.”

The journey made us merry tech explorers in a digital age full of connection possibilities. We invite you—our fellow road-trippers—on the ride. There’s no greater victory than sharing whimsical stories spiced with the zeal of discovery. When technology paves the velvet path and you, yes you, become the master navigator steering through Teams with unparalleled grace, adventure ensues!

Happy collaborating, and be sure to tell Bob we sent you.
