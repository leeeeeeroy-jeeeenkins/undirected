# Top Mistakes to Avoid When Using Hopin for Your Virtual Event

Back when we were planning our first big virtual event on Hopin, I remember sitting at my kitchen table, drowning in a sea of sticky notes and half-drunk cups of coffee. My co-organizer, Jenny, was on the other end of a shaky Zoom call, and we were both saying everything will be okay so many times that it felt like some weird mantra. Spoiler alert: things weren't okay. But hey, life is chaos personified.

Turning chaos into a manageable, somewhat coherent narrative was our task, and Hopin seemed like the all-powerful tool sent to deliver us from our suffering. What happened next was a firm lesson in what *not* to do, and this article comes to life from those initial stumbles and frustrations, in hopes to steer your ship away from the iceberg that we gleefully banged into.

## Registration Mayhem

Imagine this. Tickets were selling like hotcakes—or so we thought. The reality was our registration process turned out to be the equivalent of trying to park a cruise ship in a driveway. Here's what went wrong: 

### Clear Instructions or Bust

When setting up event registration, we neglected the fine print—the details that escape beneath the shadows of bigger tasks. We assumed people understood how to register without explicit guidance. Bad idea. This oversight led to attendees reaching out with questions en masse. Some of them seemed like they hadn’t seen such technology since the dawn of dial-up internet.

**Lesson learned:** Always craft clear, step-by-step instructions. Even better, create a short video tutorial. Make it personal! This saves a lot of back and forth. Also worth noting: test the registration path while pretending to be a tech-challenged Luddite relative. It's illuminating.

## Venue Setup: Like IKEA Furniture for the Soul

The thing about setting up your event in Hopin is that it feels a bit like assembling IKEA furniture. Everything looks deceptively straightforward until you realize you're two screws short and the instruction manual's in Swedish.

### Stage Fright: Getting Main Stage Right

Our main stage presentation had a glitch moment—a buffering eternity that felt longer than puberty. We had allocated virtually zero rehearsal time, assuming everything would work smoothly because "the internet" usually does stuff autonomously, right? Wrong.

**Recommendation:** Schedule practice runs. Lots of them. Ensure your speakers know how to navigate the platform. And while you’re at it, plan for contingencies; the virtual world mocks predictability. 

## Networking: Awkward Digital Encounters

Hopin’s networking feature is like speed dating without any of the glamor or the promise of free drinks. During our event, many attendees drifted in digital limbo, unable to connect—tech ghosting at its finest.

### Connection Gone Wrong?

Turns out, not everyone got along with Hopin's networking magic. Some people misconfigured their settings, while others were just befuddled—bless their confused souls.

**Navigation Tip:** Walk attendees through the process ahead of time. Empathize with their potential tech-phobia. Provide simple, digestible instructions on adjusting settings, preparing them for socializing over Wi-Fi.

## Booths and Sponsors: Because Ads Pay the Bills

Our sponsor booths were akin to ghost towns—full of potential but devoid of life. We realized too late we had given them little guidance or attention.

### Booths Need Love Too

While sponsors signed up eagerly, we didn't lay out how to engage or optimize their booth experience. We thought it would be self-explanatory. It wasn't.

**Promotion Pointer:** Coach your sponsors. Show them how to jazz up their booths with videos, staff interactions, and resources. Consider it a joint mission—because happy sponsors are repeat sponsors.

## Tech Support: The Silent Saviors

If the tech support team hadn’t come to our rescue, we might have turned the event into a weeklong karaoke session, which I suppose could appeal to some audiences, but let's not digress.

### Be a Prepared Host

Not everyone knew where to reach out for tech support. This left many wandering through a digital wasteland, frustrated by every tech hiccup.

**Implementation Insight:** Prioritize a clear, visible tech support link (I'd suggest making it a bright and bold beacon). Train your support crew to handle inquiries efficiently.

## Feedback Goldmine: Don’t Skip This Part

By the event's conclusion, we were akin to marathon runners seeing the finish line through a mirage. What we omitted in our delirium was asking for attendee feedback—a cardinal sin. Don't make this mistake.

### Gather, Reflect, Implement

Feedback might be a gentle slap on the wrist or a full-fledged roast. Either way, it's crucial. We realized post-event that those insights could have ironed out wrinkles.

**Action Plan:** Collect feedback with surveys. Post-event, analyze and apply it. It'll make the next run smoother.

## Keep the Drumbeat Going

At the end of the day, a virtual event is nothing without follow-up. We almost vanished into the ether without sending a thank-you or further engagement initiative. Facepalm moment.

### Build Long-Lasting Connections

Phase one of our blunder was not sending post-event content or updates. Ghosting attendees after an event equals missed opportunities.

**Strategy Suggestion:** Craft engaging follow-up emails. Share content, extend offers, tell attendees "thanks" because we all know the world needs more gratitude.

In the land of virtual gatherings, a little preparation goes a long way. As we sit here, grinning sheepishly at our past missteps, we hope our account—a cautionary tale marinated in humility and humor—helps you sidestep these lackluster narratives. Armed with these lessons, let us navigate the virtual seas with newfound clarity and a gentle kick of irreverence.
