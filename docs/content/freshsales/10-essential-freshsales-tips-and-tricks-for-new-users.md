# 10 Essential Freshsales Tips and Tricks for New Users

## The Twist of Fate That Introduced Me to Freshsales

Once upon a time, in a world overflowing with leads and opportunities, I found myself entangled in a web of spreadsheets and sticky notes—can you imagine? It was a time when Freshsales was just a name flitting around in conversations, a faint whisper promising a revolution in customer relationship management. One cold, rainy afternoon, as I sat with my steaming cup of coffee, glaring at the cluttered chaos on my screen, my colleague Emma casually mentioned, "Why not try Freshsales?" Her words were like golden nuggets thrown into an endless sea of CRM applications. That singular suggestion opened the door to a wonderland of organized leads and insightful sales metrics. Fast forward to today, and Freshsales is now our trusted companion—a digital sidekick that adds a little zing to our daily grind and here, dear reader, we share our musings.

### Tip 1: Customize Your Dashboard for Instant Gratification

Remember how Emma’s mention of Freshsales changed my CRM game? Well, the dashboard was the first thing that caught my attention—it was like stepping into a personalized control room. Here's how you can make it yours:

1. **Log in to Freshsales:** A given, but let's start with humility.
2. **Navigate to the Dashboard:** There, greet your new world!
3. **Customize Widgets:** Click on 'Customize Dashboard.' Feel free to move widgets around like a feng shui master.
4. **Add New Widgets:** Select what matters to you. Sales targets, active deals, or perhaps just the weather—hey, it’s your dashboard!
5. **Save Your Layout:** Don’t forget to save it. We don’t want any lost creations in the CRM Bermuda Triangle.

How simple it seemed, to have all my insights gleaming right there, just a glance away. It felt like finding a secret passage in a castle you lived in for years!

### Tip 2: Use Lead Scoring for Clairvoyance

Oh, the delight of meeting a lead that’s as warm as the sunbeam on a winter’s day! You can do so by setting up lead scoring—basically fortune-telling but with data:

- **Navigate to Settings:** Don’t fear the gears, my friend.
- **Select Lead Scoring:** It’s like ticking off a cheat menu.
- **Define Criteria:** Decide what’s hot or not. Maybe activity levels, source, or interaction history.
- **Assign Scores:** Don’t be shy about giving 10 points here or there. Generosity might boost your sales karma.

With reliable lead scores, I started spotting great opportunities faster than I could say “wunderbar!” And just like that, my sales radar was no longer just guessing in the fog.

### Tip 3: Embrace Email Templates for Conversational Craftsmanship

Let’s face it—crafting emails day after day can be tedious. Enter stage left: Email Templates! Compose once, personalize forever.

1. **Go to Email Templates:** It’s lurking under email settings.
2. **Create New Template:** Let those words flow from your fingertips.
3. **Placeholders are Your Friend:** Insert placeholders such as [Name] or [Company] for that personal, “Did I just write this?” touch.
4. **Save and Reuse:** Voila! You're the Michelangelo of emailing.

Using templates felt like having a wordsmith sidekick whose only mission was to polish and shine my communication. Fancy that!

### Tip 4: Integrate All the Things!

Early on, I quickly realized that having disparate apps is like herding cats. But Freshsales—like some sort of digital Pasiphaë—lets you integrate with other applications:

- **Visit Marketplace:** Click that hyperlinked text.
- **Browse or Search Integrations:** See if your favorite tools are there. Surprise!
- **One-Click to Connect:** Authorize and forget. Almost like magic, your data dances in harmony across platforms!

I swear, connecting those apps felt like aligning every galaxy in my workflow universe. Here’s to harmony!

### Tip 5: Automate Everyday Tasks with Workflow Automation

Every day is a chance to automate—or so I have now come to believe. Appreciate the zen-aligning potential of workflow automation:

1. **Enter Automation Section:** It sounds complex, but it’s actually an express lane to bliss.
2. **Create a New Workflow:** Imagine it as building your very own Rube Goldberg machine minus the clutter.
3. **Configure Triggers and Actions:** Stimulus and response, my friend—everything falls like dominoes.
4. **Activate Your Masterpiece:** Hit 'Save & Activate.' Watch as mundanity becomes a moving picture.

I have to admit, seeing tasks handle themselves freed me for more coffee breaks and creative brainwaves. Many serendipitous ideas were born in those liberated moments.

### Tip 6: Harness the Power of Sales Reports

In the grand movie of Freshsales, sales reports are the montage scene you love to watch. Dive into numbers:

- **Go to the Reports Section:** Friendly, awaiting your attention.
- **Choose Your Report:** Leads, deals, activities—each tells its own unique tale.
- **Filters and Timeframe:** The right perspective for the right moment.
- **Generate Report:** Pull back the curtain, and behold!

This newfound clarity kept us ever cooler in the face of frantic questions about pipeline forecasts and delightful what-ifs. Even your boss will score a new gauge of awe towards your newfound numbers-wizardry.

### Tip 7: Take Calls from Within With Phone Integration

Have you ever felt bound by your desk phone's spiral cord like a liberty-deprived Rapunzel? Now you can take calls right from Freshsales. Cue happy dance!

1. **Access Settings:** They’re right where you need them.
2. **Configure Phone Integration:** Bring those calls into the same clubhouse as your leads.
3. **Make and Receive Calls:** All within the comfortable confines of your CRM.
4. **Listen to Call Logs:** Perfect for post-conversation reflections.

Answering and making calls from within Freshsales began to feel like welcoming old friends into my office. So much more genuine and gesture-filled.

### Tip 8: Set Up Lead Assignment Rules

Once upon a time, I felt a bit like a matchmaker, manually pairing leads with team members. And then, I found out about automated lead assignment—hallelujah!

- **Head to Lead Assignment Settings:** The name says it all.
- **Define Rules:** Geography, expertise, or sheer whimsy—your call.
- **Automate the Pairing:** Never again must you play the middleman!

Witnessing leads automatically land on a colleague's plate gave each interaction an infallible sense of magic. Everyone was in on the secret of timely responses—and nobody felt left out in the cold.

### Tip 9: Get Visual with Sales Pipelines

I remember the first time I saw our sales pipeline visualized—a Picasso for the data-driven age! Shapes, colors, and categorizations galore.

1. **Go to the Deal Section:** Grab those leads like marbles in a jar.
2. **Create a Pipeline:** Simple as imagining your process flow.
3. **Design Stages:** Brainstorm like it's an art class. Each phase is a brushstroke.
4. **Save and Sort Deals:** Mostly drag-and-drop, à la digital revival.

Watching deals glide across the screen was like watching an orchestra in perfect synchrony—all strings intermingling, yet clear.

### Tip 10: Chatbot Shenanigans! 

Adding a Chatbot is like fitting your website with an eager receptionist who never eats cookies in the breakroom. Here’s how:

- **Head to Website Settings:** Don’t leave the homepage hanging.
- **Create and Configure Chatbot:** Persona, responses to FAQs, and curbing late-hour chat requests.
- **Deploy to Website:** Sit back and attempt resisting the temptation to check in every five minutes!

It was like having an extension of myself bustling away even when the lights dimmed in our small corner of the world—your digital emissary never rests.
