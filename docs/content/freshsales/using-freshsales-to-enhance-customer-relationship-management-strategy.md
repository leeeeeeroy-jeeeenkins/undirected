# Using Freshsales to Enhance Customer Relationship Management Strategy

It's funny how memorable some evenings can be. There we were—Marissa, our resident puzzle solver, and Raul, who can talk his way into and out of anything—sitting at a diner at three in the morning. The waitress, Edith, was a master of her trade, charming us with tales of regulars while refilling our endlessly consumed coffee cups. In the midst of a syrup-soaked revelation—one about time zones and follow-up emails—it clicked. Building relationships with customers should feel like a sincere human connection, like our chats with Edith. That’s when Freshsales slipped into our toolbox.

## The Coffee Shop of CRM

Stepping into Freshsales is like walking into a cozy coffee shop. First, there’s the aroma of possibilities. It suggests you're about to stumble onto something both familiar and refreshingly new. We tinkered around, not knowing precisely where to start, because who reads the manual first anyway? We began by defining our goals—efficiency, organization, and genuine human behavior. It was like choosing your favorite drink; ours was a brew of automation with a shot of personalization.

The first thing Freshsales offers is contact management that feels as intimate as chatting with Edith. Open contacts, and you see everything about your customers in one delightful snapshot. There’s a timeline of every interaction—emails, calls, notes—like keeping Edith’s stories in a personal chronicle. This helps us greet them with warmth and recognition each time.

## When the Espresso Machine Fights Back

I remember that one rainy day when the espresso machine resisted our deepest desires for caffeine. Freshsales’s automated email sequences had that same initial reluctance to comply with our whims. After a few frustrated—but ultimately rewarding—attempts, here’s what we learned: automation is your friend, but not without a bit of coaching.

To set it up, here’s what we did:

1. **Navigate to Sequences:** Like finding the right button on that stubborn espresso machine. In Freshsales, sequences are the days, times, and droves of email reminders and follow-ups that we set up.
   
2. **Craft Your Sequence:** We wrote our emails as if we were writing to Edith—warm, personal, and unfailingly genuine. This is one sidebar where simplicity sings a good tune. 

3. **Set Timings & Triggers:** Choose the fire-starting condition—this might be signing up for a newsletter or a well-placed curiosity click.

4. **Review & Launch:** We did a quick dance to ensure everything was spick and span. Hit send on your sequences and congratulate yourself. Don't forget the victory sip of coffee.

## Edith’s Endless Refills

Customer relationship management thrums best when fueled by insight—the kind that comes from endless refills on data. Freshsales equips us with reporting features that demystify what feels like cryptic coffee grounds, telling us what lingers longest on the palate. By generating reports, we see how our emails are received, how leads progress, and what needs the human touch. It's like having Edith’s intuition for who needs a refill and when.

Setting up reports goes like this:

1. **Choose Your Report Type:** Be it sales, communication, or prospects—like degree choices at a college. Whatever fulfills your quest for knowledge.

2. **Customize the Data:** Pick your potion—filters, fields, charts—to tell vibrant stories of KPI progress, dream leads, and unsung heroes.

3. **Visualize and Analyze:** Look at the bright infographics and charts, and let them guide your strategy. We find room to improve, celebrate victories that feel like a single tear along with a "you did it!" moment.

## Marissa’s Puzzle Pieces

Now, Marissa’s not just any puzzle solver. She fits pieces that look predestined. With Freshsales’s lead scoring, we became partial puzzle enthusiasts. Lead scoring is like assessing a tip left for Edith: size matters, but the personal note means more.

Through precise actions—call it lead scoring arithmetic—we determine a lead's readiness:

1. **Define Scoring Rules:** We assigned points for interactions that show intent (email opens, clicks, website visits, etc.), much like noting Edith’s nod as significant or her laugh as gold.

2. **Apply Lead and Revenue Attributes:** We tossed around weightage for contact and account characteristics—how fascinating someone is can be assessed with thoughtful metrics.

3. **Monitor and Refine:** With an eye on changing dynamics, adjust scores like you adjust salt after every few sips of soup.

## Raul’s Silver Tongue

Now, Raul can sweet talk even a vending machine into working without coins. His secret lies in the art of knowing when to do it. Integrated phone functionality in Freshsales works like Raul's charm—it knows precisely when to whisper a sweet nothing into a customer’s ear.

 1. **Set Up Your Phone:** Once you log in, it's as straightforward as asking Edith for an extra napkin—no frills. Add your number and be ready to dazzle. 

2. **Call Direct from Freshsales:** Click on the contact’s number and off you go. Conversations feel direct, reducing those "hang-on-let-me-check-something" moments. 

3. **Automate Call-Logging:** Less typing notes into an abyss, more focus on building camaraderie.

Our talks with Edith inspired this conversational, human-centric approach. We weave between interactions with the kind of easy rapport that makes you want to sit and chat a little longer.

## Wrapping up the Night Shift Conversations

We left the diner that night with newfound wisdom tucked under our wings. Freshsales, though a digital tool, transforms our CRM strategy into something deeply human. Edith might’ve laughed at our earlier attempts to wrangle this technology, but our shared stories lit the way through the night of data and strategy. As we walked into the neon glow, we understood that our CRM wasn’t just technology—it was the art of truly understanding and connecting with those customers as vibrantly as we did with Edith.
