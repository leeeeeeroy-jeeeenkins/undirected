# How to Set Up Real Time Alerts in Freshsales

It was a rainy Wednesday when my phone buzzed with an unexpected email. "Urgent: Potential Customer Lead," it read. With one foot still in a crumbling meeting and the other trying not to step on the cable dancing with my laptop, I almost groaned. "Why can’t things just be… automatic?" I sighed. And isn’t that the question worth pursuing?

We've all been there—juggling multiple tasks, while leads slip through the cracks like a ninja in the night. It's frustrating. Sometimes, all we need is a magical, little elf whispering in our ear when something important comes in—enter Freshsales real-time alerts. Join us as we delve into this uncharted territory with the enthusiasm of a sailor vying for the horizon of efficiency!

## The Mega Goal: No More Missed Opportunities

In that moment, I recalled an enlightening discussion with Clara from marketing—lover of toast and the queen of all things automation. "Why," she once queried, whit butter knife poised, "are we not leveraging real-time alerts in Freshsales? Do we secretly enjoy playing hide-and-seek with leads?" She had a knack for getting to the heart of things.

So, there we were, driven by this collective desire not to drop potential client interactions into the abyss, we plunged headfirst into Freshsales. Oh, if only it could be as simple as waving a wand! But alas, friends, though it's not instant, the process is rewarding.

### Setting Up Campaigns and Workflows

Alright, picture us—button-clicking like some overexcited 90s kids getting their first video games. Our minds sat at the intersection between ‘now or never’ and ‘what could possibly go wrong?’ The first step: setting up campaigns and workflows.

1. **Visit the Admin Settings:** 
   - Wielding our curiosity, we flew to the settings like geeky birds. Navigate to the “Admin Settings” found in the lower corner, which acts like the doorway to the vast possibilities that lie ahead.

2. **Select Workflows:**
   - See that “Workflows” section? Yep, give it a friendly little nudge. Probably it’ll wave back. 
   
3. **Create a New Workflow:**
   - Embark on creating a new workflow by tapping the “New Workflow” button. It’s as exhilarating as picking toppings for a pizza. Name it something snazzy, like "Lead Magic."

4. **Defining Conditions:**
   - Decide your trigger events. Maybe it’s a new incoming lead, or a customer interaction. Our wise Clara encouraged us to keep it relevant, yet diverse—just like a mixed bouquet of daisies and lilies.

5. **Add Actions:**
   - Choose “Real-time Alerts” as your action. Imagine you’re equipping each workflow with its own tiny siren. Personalize your alert with fun, persuasive messages or simple reminders.

6. **Test and Activate:**
   - Hooray, don your science goggles, and test the workflow. When satisfied, activate it, setting it free into the wild world of automations.

The satisfaction of completing these steps was akin to assembling a complicated furniture piece without swearing even once.

## Smartphone Times: Setting Up Mobile Alerts

While scrolling through cat videos over the weekend—self-care, people—I realized, “Wouldn’t it be grand if we had Freshsales alerts directly on our smartphones?” Turns out, future-thinking Clara had already been nibbling around this idea too.

### Feel the Vibes on the Go

1. **Download the Freshsales App:**
   - Scurry to your app store, just like Clara hunting down rare plant species. Download and install the Freshsales mobile app.

2. **Enable Notifications:**
   - Inside the app, twirl gracefully to Settings. Here, ensure notifications are turned on. It's like plugging in a fairy light strand—simple, and instantly brightens things up.

3. **Personalize Alerts:**
   - Journey over to notification settings within the Freshsales app to decide which notifications make their way to your phone. No one needs a flood of chaos while forest-bathing, right?

### Bonus: Email Alerts

Janice, from accounts, extolled email alerts. "When's the last time I missed something important?" she quipped. "Never," came her sole answer.

1. **Access Notifications in Desktop Settings:**
   - Back on your faithful desktop creation, navigate again to Admin Settings and find the “Notifications” section.

2. **Customize and Save:**
   - Tailor which alerts hit your pristine inbox and save the settings. Always pertinent, never invasive.

## Feedback from the Frontlines

It was Monday again, and Clara was sipping her umpteenth coffee. "You know," she mused, processing the smooth miracle that is caffeine, "without real-time alerts, Eric nearly missed that client’s email last Friday." This was, truly, the crescendo of our journey. By setting up these alerts, we ensured Eric—and indeed, all of us—could seize the day, every day.

Embrace these steps into your Freshsales experience. Turn them into your journey—a journey that promises adventure, discovery, and hopefully lots fewer missed customer interactions. We're all in this quest together, forever grateful to those unforeseen rainy Wednesdays that push us toward the magical revelations of tech.

Thus, let us set sail, with no lead or opportunity left unturned. Join hands with Clara, Janice, Eric, and us, for in the world of real-time alerts, we're not only surviving but thriving. And maybe, just maybe, we can do it all without stepping on computer cables again... well, no promises.
