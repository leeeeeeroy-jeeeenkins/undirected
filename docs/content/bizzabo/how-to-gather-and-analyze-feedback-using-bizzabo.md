# How To Gather And Analyze Feedback Using Bizzabo

It was on a crisp autumn day, the one where the leaves gently whispered secrets as they fell, that we found ourselves pondering the mysteries of feedback. We were in the middle of planning our annual tech conference. Packed schedules, brewing coffee, fingers clicking away on keyboards - it was the perfect cauldron of creativity. But amidst this chaos, a simple yet profound question emerged: how do we truly know what people think? Sure, head nods and applause are great, but real feedback is the gold we're after. That’s when Bizzabo entered our lives. Just like that plot twist you never saw coming… in a summer blockbuster. This is the story of our dance with Bizzabo, a magical tool that makes gathering and analyzing feedback not just possible, but dare I say, enjoyable?

## Getting Started with Bizzabo

First things first. Let’s unwrap the enigma that is Bizzabo. No need to squint suspiciously - it’s a platform designed to help us host events and collect feedback. It all started when Elaine, our tech guru who mysteriously knows every single software ever created, suggested, "Hey, why not use Bizzabo? It's got nifty feedback features." And just like that, we were off to the races.

### Setting Up Your Event

To begin our journey into feedback paradise, we needed to set up our event on Bizzabo. Elaine walked us through the process like a seasoned explorer - with several cups of chamomile tea by her side. We navigated to the Bizzabo dashboard, where we were greeted by a friendly interface. 

1. **Create a New Event:** Click on the big 'Create New Event' button. This is our canvas, ready for our masterpiece.

2. **Event Details:** Fill in the nitty-gritty - date, time, venue (or virtual links, of course). Think of this as the setting for our feedback gold mine.

3. **Customization:** Add your flair. Logo, colors, the works. Because who doesn’t love branding, right? 

4. **Set Permissions:** Elaine, with her tech wisdom, reminded us to decide who among us gets to tinker with the event settings. We’re in charge of the power!

We filled out our event information passionately, like artists shaping clay into something exquisite. It didn’t take long before our event page was alive, vibrant, and ready to receive real-time feedback.

### Creating Feedback Forms

Now, the heart of it all: those magical feedback forms. Think of them as our feedback nets, cast wide to capture nuggets of wisdom.

1. **Navigate to Feedback Section:** Once in the dashboard, click on the ‘Feedback’ tab, which Elaine said felt a bit like opening a treasure chest.

2. **Create a New Form:** This is where our creativity shines brighter than a supernova.

3. **Design Questions:** Multiple-choice, open-ended, rating scales - we had choices like kids in a candy store. We structured our questions to feel personal, like asking a friend for advice. What did you love? What could we do better? Fire away.

4. **Save and Deploy:** Save our masterpiece and deploy it with a click that felt almost ceremonious.

We chuckled when George, our resident jokester, suggested adding "What did you detest the most?" to the form. Naturally, we refined it to "What aspect could be improved?" But his humor had already lightened our creative process.

## Collecting Feedback During the Event

The event day arrived with all the anticipation of a new rollercoaster ride. The crowd was buzzing, microphones were adjusted every few seconds, and our feedback forms were ready to catch audience insights like butterflies.

### Engaging Attendees

It was Betty who came up with a brilliant idea - to encourage feedback, she created a fun competition. Submitting feedback forms earned attendees a chance to win cool swag. Yes, people love swag. Almost as much as free coffee.

### Feedback as Real-Time Data

As the event unfolded, we watched feedback roll in faster than Uncle Roger judging a fried rice recipe. Bizzabo’s real-time data collection showed us live reactions. 

```
{
  "feedback": [
    {
      "session": "Opening Keynote",
      "rating": 4.5,
      "comments": "Great speaker!"
    },
    {
      "session": "Tech Panel",
      "rating": 4.0,
      "comments": "Loved the insights!"
    }
  ]
}
```
Numbers and comments flowed, painting a vivid picture. We could adjust on the fly - like when we realized one room needed more chairs (Feedback: “I had to sit on the floor - not cool”). Elaine promptly organized more seating.

## Analyzing Feedback Like a Pro

With the event behind us, it was time to cozy up with cups of hot cocoa and dive into the feedback analysis. 

### Feedback Dashboard

The Bizzabo feedback dashboard felt like entering a world of limitless possibilities. Charts, graphs, summaries - our data was transformed into a symphony. 

1. **Overall Summary:** See your event's overall rating. It’s like checking the critics’ reviews post-movie premiere.

2. **Detailed Session Feedback:** Each session dissected like a science project (in the good way). 

3. **Comment Analysis:** Elaine’s favorite - reading through comments felt like our own little novel. Each reaction adding to the bigger picture.

### Identifying Patterns

We spotted patterns - a fascinating puzzle of human reaction. Attendees loved the tech panel but thought the opening keynote could be snappier. 

Using filters, we drilled down into specifics. Feedback from first-time attendees? Check. Opinions from our VIP section? Check. George even noted someone mentioning Elaine’s chamomile tea choice.

### Actionable Insights

The golden nuggets of actionable insights gleamed brightly. We made improvements, set goals for our next event, and learned in ways we hadn’t anticipated. We took note - much like pirates marking their treasure maps with great anticipation. 

## Closing Thoughts: The Dance of Feedback

As we wrapped up this journey, I marveled at how feedback, once a murky swamp of uncertainty, had turned into a dynamic partner in our dance of events and experiences. Bizzabo was our trusty partner leading the way with an elegance I never knew event software could have.

Elaine smiled as she announced we had achieved a feedback response rate of over 80%. George was already thinking of new jokes for the next event, and Betty daydreamed about what swag to give away. Amidst our planning and laughter, it was clear: we had found a valuable tool and a method that intertwined our stories with those of our attendees.

And so, just like that - in a few steps and clicks - gathering and analyzing feedback became a shared adventure that brought our team closer and transformed each event into an ever-evolving masterpiece. That’s the magic of feedback. And with Bizzabo, it's always a click away.

And we agreed, on that crisp autumn day, to embrace feedback not as criticism, but as a whisper from the universe telling us how we can be better. Together.
