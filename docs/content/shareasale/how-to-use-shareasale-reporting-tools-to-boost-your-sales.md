# How to Use ShareASale Reporting Tools to Boost Your Sales

Have you ever tried to juggle flaming torches while holding a live chicken in your other hand? Now imagine the chicken is your sales data and the torches are your marketing campaigns. That's kind of what my first foray into the chaos of affiliate marketing felt like—an unwieldy mess poised to ignite at any moment. I remember sitting in a dimly lit corner of my home office, eyes bleary from staring at my screen, contemplating why the sales weren't climbing despite my Herculean efforts. That's when ShareASale's reporting tools became my beacon of hope, my guiding star across the turbulent sea of data. 

Let's rewind, breathe deep, and dive into our own journey with ShareASale to unveil how these tools can transform your sales landscape.

## The Awakening: Discovering ShareASale's Magic

Imagine waking up one morning and realizing you've been using a hammer instead of a mouse—effective but not ideal. This illuminating moment struck when I stumbled upon ShareASale's reporting tools. We all want to peek behind the curtain to make sense of the roaring crowd (or lack thereof) in our sales theater. But where do we start?

1. **Log Into the Portal**: First things first, we need to log into the ShareASale dashboard (https://account.shareasale.com). Insert those secretive, password-protected details you've stashed away and behold—a world of data laid bare before you.

2. **Navigate to Reports**: Upon entry, you're afforded a glimpse of your domain: promotional tools, merchants, and, importantly, the reports section. We click on ‘Reports’ nestled comfortably in the navigation bar.

3. **Understanding Report Types**: Like any good choose-your-own-adventure novel, numerous pathways lie ahead. In our pursuit, let’s explore a few fan favorites: **Performance by Day**, **Traffic Reports**, and the enigmatic **Void Transactions** report. Each of these reports gives us tools akin to a wizard's spells, ready to be employed strategically.

### Performance by Day: Unmasking the Daily Trends

Venturing into the "Performance by Day" report is akin to uncovering ancient runes that illuminate our daily quests. This report reveals daily sales and performance metrics that help us spot trends hiding in plain sight.

- **Select Date Range**: We start by choosing our desired time period. Whether it's the latest moon cycle or the fiscal year, this defines our lens.

- **Analyze Daily Data**: Notice how some days your campaigns soar like majestic eagles, while others dip unexpectedly. Which days correspond with marketing efforts? Dare we uncover causal connections?

This report turns into a daily dance card, letting us time our campaigns for maximum impact. Adjust strategies based on these rhythms—it's like surfing, but with sales.

### Traffic Reports: The Lifelines of Your Campaign

In the vast ocean of marketing, traffic is like the currents that carry our messages to distant shores. Understanding this could send our conversions skyrocketing.

- **Click Through to ‘Traffic’**: Here, we're exploring the number of clicks, sources, and time on site. It's like peeking through the keyhole into the behavior of curious visitors.

- **Refine Your Traffic Sources**: Pinpoint which sources are the bubbling springs sustaining your river of clicks. Is it the usual suspects—SEO, PPC, or is some elusive dark horse leaving you puzzled?

Navigating this report, we arm ourselves with insights to double down on high-performing channels and rework or eliminate the sluggish ones.

### Void Transactions: The Unseen Shadows

Ah, the elusive shadow of void transactions—a report that whispers of sales lost to the ether.

- **Insights on Returned Sales**: This tool gives us the unenviable reality of transactions that didn’t hold firm. Sort through chargebacks or returns, those moments when we quietly curse the winds for unfavorable turns.

- **Identify Patterns**: Are returns clustering around certain products or periods? Perhaps a deeper issue needs addressing, or maybe our policies need a tweak.

While this might feel like sailing under a stormy sky, it teaches us resilience and the art of navigating around future hazards.

## The Mastery: Strategic Use of Data

By now, perhaps you're sharing my epiphany—a clear path from chaotic fire-drill to laser-focused tactics. With these insights in hand, we think like strategists, tacticians in the arena of sales.

1. **Adjust Campaigns Based on Data**: Using the daily performance insights, recalibrate your campaigns. Double efforts in successful time frames, and rethink strategy when the winds shift.

2. **Boost High-Traffic Sources**: Where traffic thrives, conversions loiter nearby. Bedazzle your top traffic sources with exclusive offers or tailor-made ads to turn potential into profit.

3. **Respond to Void Transactions**: Address the root cause of high-return items. It might be time for better product descriptions, enhanced customer service, or seasoned social proof to bolster confidence.
