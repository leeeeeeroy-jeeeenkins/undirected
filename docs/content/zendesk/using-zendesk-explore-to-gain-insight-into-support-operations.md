# Using Zendesk Explore to Gain Insight into Support Operations

It was one of those Monday mornings, the kind where coffee spills on your favorite shirt and the cat decides your laptop is their new bed. Peter, our support operations hero, booted up his computer with the same trepidation that one might approach a sleeping lion with. "We need more insight," he had said during last Friday's meeting, the same meeting where he also admitted he'd never actually used Zendesk Explore. Yet, here we were, ready to dive headfirst into data analytics with every confidence of a toddler about to ride a bicycle for the first time—without training wheels.

## The Awakening Moment

Before we ever touched Zendesk Explore, it started with a question: "Why do our support tickets take forever to resolve?" Not rhetorical—very much a cry for help. Peter sat staring at rows upon rows of ticket data that looked more like hieroglyphs than insights. That’s when someone, probably me, casually suggested using Zendesk Explore. You know, maybe it was time to put those licenses we’ve been paying for to good use.

### Starting the Adventure

So we begin, comrades, by navigating to the Zendesk dashboard. Our destination: the tantalizing world of Explore. Right after reluctantly installing yet another browser update, Peter clicked on the little compass icon that said "Explore"—nothing fancy, no confetti or applause. Just a click, and there we were.

#### Step 1: Accessing Zendesk Explore

In the realm of Zendesk Explore, getting in is quite blissful. First, log into Zendesk, as if we're taking a leisurely morning stroll into familiar surroundings. Look for the compass icon on the sidebar—oh yes, it's there by its lonesome, waiting to take you into a realm of data magic.

#### Step 2: Navigating the Data Jungle

Inside Explore, we went on an expedition. Imagine opening a treasure chest—data streams, reports, dashboards—all waiting for your curious eyes. Peter was like a kid in a candy store, eyes wide and fingers ready to click all the shiny things.

*Pro tip:* Begin with the pre-built dashboards. They’re like the fast-food of reports—quick, easy, and satisfying—without the side of guilt. Zendesk Explore offers dashboards for various aspects of support operations, like tickets, SLAs, and team performance. Click on one, and watch as charts and graphs spring to life like a beautiful blooming flower.

#### Step 3: Understanding the Metrics

“When in doubt, measure everything,” they say, whoever "they" are, but sometimes less is more. We honed in on key metrics: ticket resolution times, customer satisfaction scores, and first response times. Each metric was a piece of the puzzle in understanding our support operations. 

We laughed when we discovered response times that were shorter than some of our team's lunch breaks. Apparently, Karl from support had been setting speed records with single-word responses. Not exactly what customers were hoping for, but hey, it was data.

### Deep Diving into Custom Reports

##### The Aha! Moment

It’s like finding an extra cookie in the jar. Peter created his first custom report, an amalgamation of ticket priority and agent performance. He felt like a sorcerer conjuring spells from a dusty tome. Now, it’s not as mystical as it sounds, but watching your data rearrange under your direction is something close to magic.

#### Step 4: Building Custom Reports

To build a custom report, we had to embrace our inner artist—think data meets Picasso. Click on `Create new report`, and select a dataset. Here, picking the right dataset is crucial; it’s the difference between painting a Mona Lisa and a doodle.

Once selected, we dragged and dropped data attributes and metrics. Yes, this is real life: picking and placing data plots like puzzle pieces that somehow tell you everything you need to know without uttering a single word.

#### Step 5: Adding Filters and Drill-Downs

Building a report is one thing, but making it useful? That’s the key. We added filters to home in on specific issues—like figuring out why morning tickets took longer to resolve (spoiler: pre-coffee brain fog). Drill-downs were our magnifying glasses, letting us peek into the granular details of any metric.

### Creating Dashboards of Glory

The journey was nearing its climax: creating dashboards. It feels like summoning your very own Voltron made out of widgets and charts, all working in unison.

#### Step 6: Piecing Together a Dashboard

Our pièce de résistance—a dashboard that even our fearless leader found impressive (or maybe he was just happy it was not an Excel sheet for once). We combined reports to create a visual smorgasbord that showcased our KPIs, ticket trends, and even a weird chart that nobody was quite sure how it got there but decided they liked it.

#### Step 7: Sharing with the World—Or Just the Team

Dashboards aren’t meant to be desserts you hoard but rather gourmet meals you share. Peter gleefully shared the dashboard with the team. There was a collective “woah” followed by discussions, insights, and a rare motivational upsurge. Knowledge is powerful, but shared knowledge? That's the recipe for change.

### Reflecting on the Journey

##### Revelations and Revelry

Days turned into weeks, and with that, our familiarity with Zendesk Explore grew. It’s funny how data can be one of the most boring words but becomes enthralling when you see it as a story—our story. Each chart, graph, and number was a lesson, a glimpse into how we support our customers and how we could do better.

In the end, our team wasn’t just looking at numbers or rates anymore. We were deciphering behaviors, predicting trends, and feeling pretty empowered doing it, too. We realized that gaining insights is not about finding answers; it’s about asking better questions.

#### Final Thoughts

Using Zendesk Explore was like finding a map when all we had was a compass. It gave us direction, clarity, and a sense of adventure—like wandering but with purpose. For us, it turned the often mundane data analytics into a journey of discovery akin to finding secret rooms in our own, very familiar house. So here's to insights, adventures, and kitten-free keyboards.
