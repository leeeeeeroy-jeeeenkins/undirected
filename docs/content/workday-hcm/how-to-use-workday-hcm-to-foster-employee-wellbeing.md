# How to Use Workday HCM to Foster Employee Wellbeing

Remember that morning when we were sipping our second cups of oversized mugs filled to the parchment with coffee — we’d abandoned measuring spoonfuls in favor of eyeballing the caffeine content as a form of art. We were huddled close around a virtual flame that was our company’s HR portal, trying to fathom a Gordian knot of processes that no one seemed to understand, and that’s when I thought to myself, “There’s got to be a better way to show our people we care.” Then, like a whispered wish upon a shooting star, Workday HCM found its way into our lives — not by preordination but because our HR tech savant, Paul, leaned in and simply said, “Let’s give this a whirl.”

In those first few steps, fumbling and navigating Workday like toddlers learning to walk, we discovered a platform purpose-built for more than tracking hours or managing benefits. It was something we couldn’t believe at first — something that could grow with us, nurture our tribe, not just automate paychecks but elevate our entire approach to wellbeing. Let's break it down, and I promise, there’s a method to this magic.

## Setting the Stage for Wellbeing

Picture us huddled around Paul’s laptop, a motley crew of innovators clad in plaid and pursuing happiness through spreadsheets. Like explorers of the new world, we were searching for a hidden map within Workday’s dashboard — a treasure of untapped potential and promise. “We’ll start with the basics,” Paul proclaimed with the wisdom of a thousand YouTube tutorials, “let’s set up a home for all our wellbeing resources.” 

Within Workday, navigate to the dashboard. It’s here we create a bespoke wellbeing portal — an Info Mart or treasure trove if you will. Insert resources, guides, and wellness programs, a digital sanctuary for mental health tips and virtual yoga. You just click ‘Create’ and let your imagination run wild. It was like having a cozy reading corner or a relaxation nook for our team to rest and recharge during their digital days. 

Upon doing this, we discovered that constructing the scaffolding for wellbeing was more intuitive than expected. Just like that, we were building a world designed to support, encourage, and softly whisper, “We care.” 

## Personalization: The Secret Ingredient

Now, if I were to tell you we became mind readers overnight, that’d be a tall tale most fantastic. No, what happened next was something better — personalization at the touch of our fingertips. Just imagine Peggy from accounting not only plugged into a system that acknowledges her penchant for afternoon Zumba classes but actively reminds her when sessions are available.

The personalization settings in Workday are what we effectively call digital empathy. By navigating through multiple labyrinthine tabs — think ‘Preferences’ and ‘Profile Settings’ — we could weave unique paths for every soul in our team. It’s where you adjust the notification settings and create custom alerts about health challenges or stress-busting workshops that feel tailored and personal.

Creating personalized experiences isn’t a matter of installing an app and calling it a day. It’s like putting the kettle on — it needs attention to how long it boils. It’s where we earnestly hope every encounter feels less generic and more like an invitation crafted just for them.

## Harnessing Analytics for Insightful Wellbeing

Analytics was Paul’s favorite word, the same way others treasure the sound of a violin reaching crescendo. He’d usher us into a room and regale tales of data becoming the light in vast darkness — an oracle sworn to reveal the hidden wants and needs of our people.

To harness these insights, head over to Workday’s Reports. Select wellbeing metrics and track stress levels — they’re depicted as lovely little graphs that reveal trends or spikes, and sometimes dips. It’s almost poetic, how these numbers sing stories of real people’s struggles and triumphs. We used these insights to tell when Jane from HR needed an extra long weekend or when Sam in design might need a motivational boost.

By minding this data, we reach a place where decisions are no longer stabs in the fog but targeted expressions of support. Engaging in such enlightened stewardship feels like winning a sacred trust from our employees — one shared look of understanding at a time.

## Cultivating Communication

Do you remember that toast we raised, glasses clinking in the digital breeze, where we declared that really speaking with our folks was far superior than barking orders from the megaphone of tradition? Enter Workday’s Survey Tools — where communication is a garden, not a monologue.

We created pulse surveys, deployed amongst our tribe, and asked questions that mattered — “How’s your heart today?” versus “Rate your experience on a numeric scale.” Surveys then fed back to us, bridging the chasm between silos of isolation and collective connectivity. 

Our communication wasn’t perfect art nor scientific study; it was human. Workday became our vehicle, the means for voices to rise gently above the cacophony, letting individuals like Tamara in support team express longing for flexible lunch hours. And we listened, proof written in action and adjustments made.

## Promoting an Inclusive Culture

Lest we forget, fostering inclusivity is the masterpiece of employee wellbeing. Workday, surprisingly, became more than our paintbrush — it morphed into the canvas altogether. 

We orchestrated learning paths celebrating diverse backgrounds and championing varied voices. There’s a feature, dear readers, the ‘Learning’ app inside Workday. It’s there we nurtured modules on unconscious bias or intercultural appreciation, leaving none of our tribe excluded from the table.

It wasn’t easy, and often, we found ourselves untangling knots we hadn’t known existed, but embracing these challenges through Workday grew us into a tapestry woven tight with respect and mutual support—a community whole in its multitude.

## Conclusion: A Journey Worth Sharing

Here we stand, months later, looking back at a journey paved with naive ambition and boundless curiosity. Workday HCM wasn’t merely an accessory; it became a partner in this journey of fostering wellbeing — a kindred spirit matching pace with our idiosyncratic dance of corporate life.

Within its digital contours, we found the means to show empathy, understanding, and create not just a workforce, but a family. And I hope, as you sip your next oversized mug of coffee, warm and brewed just right, that you might find some inspiration here to make the world of work a little kinder, more human, and indefinitely more joyous.

Here’s to us, dear friends, navigating Workday, life, and everything in between. Cheers!
