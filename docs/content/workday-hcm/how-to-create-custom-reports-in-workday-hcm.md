# How to Create Custom Reports in Workday HCM

So there I was, basking in the incandescent glow of my laptop screen one Tuesday afternoon when reality hit me like a cast iron skillet to the face—I had to create custom reports in Workday HCM. You know, those mystical beasts everyone speaks of but few have dared to tame. To be honest, I'd always wanted to be a brave explorer, mapping out uncharted territories and sharing tales of discovery with friends over coffee. Yet here I was, confined to my desk, unraveling the secrets of Workday. But hey, every great journey begins with a single, bold step, right? Let's delve in.

## The Prequel: Understanding the Wily Ways of Workday

Before we dive headlong into the step-by-step, let's talk about the purpose of this digital odyssey—creating custom reports in Workday HCM. Why, you ask? Imagine you're a master chef but all you've got is a microwave and a frozen meal. That's your Workday without custom reports. They transform your simplistic view into a gourmet feast of data insights.

Our initial escapade was an eye-opener. I vividly remember staring at my screen, its vastness staring back. I imagined it whispering cryptic challenges like a wise old sage—"If you wish to create custom reports, you must first understand my depths." So with a determined nod and caffeine-fueled vigor, we set about our quest.

## Step 1: The Quest to Locate the Report Writer

Embarking on this journey? First, locate the Report Writer in Workday. Picture Lewis and Clark reaching the Pacific—it feels something like that. Click on the trusty search bar, akin to the compass guiding explorers, and type in “Create Custom Report.”

Once found, select it. I remember fondly a moment of hesitation—"Will it work?" I pondered, fingers hovering. And lo, a world of possibilities appeared!

## Step 2: Choosing the Report Type

Armed with Luke Skywalker levels of determination, our next task was to decide on the type of report. Options, dear friends, unfurled before us: "Advanced," "Matrix," "Trending," each sounding like secret levels in a video game. For this tale, let's select "Advanced," a decision we made after much hemming and hawing, akin to choosing toppings for a pizza.

Why advanced, you ask? Well, it's like building a custom burger—select every ingredient, the precise proportion, balance the nuances.

## Step 3: Naming Your Masterpiece

Now, dear reader, comes the moment where we pour our creative spirit into a title. Naming a report is like naming a child—except this one will only ever need data diapers. Choose something descriptive as though you're titling the next bestseller. Remember John from Accounting? Inspired by his endless spreadsheet sagas, we named our first report "John's Analytical Odyssey."

## Step 4: Dipping into Data Sources

Here comes the crux, the meat and potatoes! It's time to choose your data sources. Think of it like selecting ingredients for a grand feast. Remember when Jane threw together a potluck with just Pringles and Orange Fanta? Let's not do that.

Select the appropriate data sources relevant to the report's purpose—get them right, and you’re halfway to genius level.

## Step 5: Filter and Refine

Filtering data felt much like sculpting marble, chipping away the excess to reveal David in all his glory. Apply filters as if you're panning for gold. Our initial attempts, adding a filter here and there, felt clunky. But with practice, we learned to wield filters like an artisan's tool—refining, honing until the truly valuable emerged.

## Step 6: Display and Distribute

Ah, the presentation of your magnum opus! Configure columns and sort data with the flair of a trapeze artist leaping through hoops. I remember fondly comparing it to arranging a bouquet—each flower perfectly selected and placed to enhance the overall display.

After this intricate dance, comes distribution. Share your creation with those who dared you to venture on this quest—people like John's supervisor, ever in need of fresh perspectives.

## Conclusion: Reflecting on the Journey

As we sat back, contemplating the digital masterpiece before us, the odometer marked every step taken. We learned that creating custom reports in Workday HCM isn’t simply about data. It’s about transforming numbers into a narrative—a personal fairy tale of facts ready to be told.

Reflecting on this journey, we knew more than we did yesterday. Our digital explorations, like all great stories, came with their highs, their lows—with a postcard ending. And all along, as we ventured, we wished to share our experiences. To leave a bread crumb trail for our dear friends, much like you're with us now. Thanks for joining on this personal narrative adventure. Let's file this story away, like an old parchment scroll, and conquer new horizons.
