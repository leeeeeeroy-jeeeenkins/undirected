# How to Create a Culture of Continuous Feedback in Workday HCM

Have you ever found yourself sitting in an office, sipping lukewarm coffee as the clock ticks obnoxiously slowly, stuck in a meeting where the word “feedback” is tossed around like confetti at a parade all while feeling like a robot with outdated software? Well, we’ve all been there. But there was one particular meeting I remember vividly, sitting across from my manager, Karen—yes, the proverbial Karen, bless her heart—who had a knack for turning feedback sessions into a monologue about why her cat deserved a gold medal for "Best Stunts Ever". It was painful yet amusing, amusing mostly because her cat had more charisma than our entire feedback culture combined.

Now, this got me thinking—how could we craft a culture that isn’t a snooze-fest but actually buzzes with life? Enter Workday HCM (Human Capital Management), a nifty tool that promised to revamp how we give and receive feedback. So, what did we do? We embarked on a journey—cue the metaphoric sails billowing in the wind—to discover the secrets of nurturing continuous feedback. So, friend, come along as we dive into detail and dissect this beast called Workday HCM to create something as lively as Karen's award-worthy feline, but way more functional.

## The Catalyst for Change: Why Continuous Feedback?

Our old system was as worn-out as our office chairs, creaking with each 'constructive criticism' that was anything but. Remember Bob from IT? Bob wasn't crazy about surprises, especially those that involved telling him how his "innovative coding techniques" were not so much innovative as they were perplexing. **Continuous feedback**, we realized, was like taking the scenic route on a road trip instead of the highway—sure, it might seem lengthy, but boy, do you enjoy the view!

Yet, this was no carnival ride; it was a well-thought revolution. We decided that feedback shouldn’t be an annual event lined with dread like a dentist appointment but a seamless daily conversation. Here's how Workday HCM became a trusty co-pilot in this transformation:

### Step 1: Setting Up Feedback Channels in Workday HCM

Imagine the sheer joy of skydiving without a parachute—wait, that’s terrifying—but bear with me, that's how it felt navigating feedback without proper channels. Workday HCM provided us with a solution—constructing customized channels was like adding a safety net made of marshmallows: supportive and delightful.

- **Create Your Templates**: The first thing we did was to build feedback templates within Workday. Picture templates as the scaffolding that holds your feedback firmly. This allowed us to keep the conversation focused and relevant, so Bob knew exactly which part of his "unconventional looping techniques" were impressive and which were just... stunningly chaotic.
  
- **Set Frequencies**: We dialed down the anxiety knob by establishing how often feedback was to be given. Workday allows you to incorporate and suggest check-ins daily, weekly, or monthly. We went for weekly with room for impromptu bursts of appreciation or advice which felt like adding sprinkles to ice cream—spontaneous and delightful.

### Step 2: Encouraging Real-Time Feedback with Meaning

I once gave feedback to Jane, our marketing guru, during lunch—and—mind you, she was mid spaghetti slurp. It wasn’t the best timing, but it harbored a realization: feedback, like dessert, should be served at the right moment.

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Workday HCM lets you send nudges and notifications for real-time feedback. This humanizes feedback by timing it to the context, similar to how giving someone a high-five for solving Sudoku makes more sense immediately after rather than years down the road.

- **Personalized Feedback Streams**: We constructed feedback streams for different roles, allowing each person from Jill in accounting to Ron in logistics—our very own treasure map to guide navigation and ensure no one drinks too much coffee while decoding irrelevant feedback.

### Step 3: Training for Open Communication

We realized that feedback was an art form. Michelangelo didn't paint the Sistine Chapel overnight, and similarly, we had to get our team skilled in the art of feedback under the tutelage of Workday’s tools—an engaging facet that felt a bit like discovering secret levels in a video game.

- **Feedback Workshops**: With Workday, it was easier to schedule and coordinate workshops that focused on practicing giving and receiving effective feedback. This turned Karen’s monologue nightmares into dialogues—more jazz duets than one-person symphonies.

- **Friendly Follow-Ups**: Designing continuous feedback included consistent follow-ups scheduled through Workday. It was like having a conversation with an old friend; checking in to laugh about previous mistakes and flavorful accomplishments.

### Step 4: Building Trust with Feedback Customization

Do you know what built major trust in our feedback culture - customizing feedback? Workday’s ability to tailor experiences meant we could cater to individual preferences and styles. For instance, Bob liked his feedback served straight to the point, no frills, Jane? She was more interested in the story behind the numbers.

- **Feedback Categories**: Dividing feedback into categories allowed each individual in our diverse troop to focus on areas they were either rocking or areas that needed a little spit-shine. Categories turned the feedback process from reading War and Peace to flipping through a comic book—enticing and concise.

- **Anonymous Feedback**: There’s something about invisibility that makes people bolder—and braver, sometimes like superheroes in disguise—giving honest rant-free feedback without fearing retribution. Workday’s anonymous feature allowed honest opinions to flow freely.

## Celebrating Success: Keep the Feedback Flowing

Our culture shift, filled with little victories and lessons learned, was like watching a garden grow from mere seeds to a different burst of colors and fragrances. We celebrated achievements to encourage continuous development and captured each moment with Workday’s insights and analytics—a personal favorite of mine, akin to collecting memorabilia from a satisfying journey.

### Step 5: Utilizing Analytics and Insights

Some say numbers are the language of the universe. While that may seem a bit grandiose in a work setting, analytics through Workday provided an eye-opening bounty of insights.

- **Dashboard Insights**: Dashboards became our canvas where we painted our progress chart, marking triumphs and areas that needed more watering. It was data that didn’t just sit pretty but propelled us forward.

- **Action Steps from Analysis**: Through visual trends, we identified gaps and addressed them, turning feedback into action. It was as if Workday handed us a crystal ball—minus the carnival fortune teller—for predicting and creating outcomes.

## Reflections and New Beginnings

Looking back, from the confetti-toss to the lively feedback exchanges of today, my heart warms at the metamorphosis. No longer do we drag our feet into feedback sessions; they're like a favorite book we can't wait to revisit. Like any gripping story—filled with unexpected yet delightful plot twists—our journey in weaving continuous feedback in Workday HCM was more than a simple process. It became a synergy of collective craftsmanship, with every chat fizzling with innovation and humanity.

And so, here's an ode to you and me, embarking on further adventures, bravely humanizing the workplace. Cheers to the non-boring, ever-evolving, joyous practice of feedback—a daily dose kind of brilliance we now thank Workday HCM for nurturing.
