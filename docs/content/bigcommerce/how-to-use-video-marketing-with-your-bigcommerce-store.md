# How To Use Video Marketing With Your BigCommerce Store

Once upon a time, in that peculiar realm between midnight and dawn, we found ourselves huddled around a flickering computer screen, wrestling with the enigmatic algorithms of the internet gods. It was there, half-asleep and draped in the comforting embrace of a worn-out hoodie, that we realized something: pixelated videos were silently conquering the e-commerce universe. We were spellbound. Videos—those once-novel snippets of moving pictures—were weaving magic and telling stories that digits and words just couldn't match.

Here's the thing: tapping into the power of video marketing with your BigCommerce store doesn't require a degree from Hogwarts. It's about human connection, authenticity, and the quintessential battle between "that product is pretty too" and "I absolutely need this in my life right now." As pioneers, we've chosen the latter.

## The Day We Fell in Love with Video Marketing

Ah, that fateful day—you remember it, don’t you? The sun streamed through the blinds, and we sat entranced by a short clip featuring a pair of impossibly fluffy kittens playing in a box. Suddenly, a high-pitched "Buy Meow" echoed through the halls of our consciousness. It was purr-fection. Adoption was a mere formality, as credit cards stood no chance against feline charm. But it wasn’t just the kittens—what caught our attention was the realization that a thirty-second video made us do something. 

Now, channeled into our BigCommerce world, that realization fuels our strategy. If kittens could do it, so could our products—and it all begins here.

### Step 1: Choose Your Video Type Wisely

It's like picking a travel companion. Each type brings something unique to the adventure. Tutorials wear the mantle of wisdom, offering customers knowledge straight out of the gate. Product demonstrations do the heavy-lifting—highlighting what's best and brightest. Customer testimonials serve the public by rallying the troops with their heartfelt endorsements.

We recall chatting with Olivia, whose passion for antique teapots was palpable. She swirled her camera around her finest porcelain prize, whispering secret tales of origin. Those stories, those nods to craftsmanship, caught fire because viewers felt the heartbeat behind them.

When choosing a video type, ask yourself a hundred questions. What story do we wish to tell? What journey do we want our viewers to embark upon? Our adventure is theirs now.

### Step 2: Script It, But Don't Forget to Improvise

Think of a script as a compass—it gives direction but doesn't dictate every move. We've all been there, poised with the camera rolling, the lights burning bright like a thousand suns, and we freeze. Words slip away, lost in the ether. The solution? Start with a framework. Jot down those key bullet points and let your creativity roam free within their boundaries.

Remember Percy from accounting? The man with an aversion to public speaking startled us all by improvising a video about hand-carved wooden spoons. His quirky humor—a lost art in woodwork presentation—turned a mundane tutorial into a memorable escapade, propelling average spoons to superstar status.

Embrace authenticity, embrace imperfections—they make your story, our story.

### Step 3: Equipment Doesn't Make the Movie Star

Oh, how easily we fall prey to glittering gadgets, thinking, just this once, it's the camera that'll capture our vision flawlessly. But remember, all the greats—Doc Brown, Marty McFly, moonwalking Michael Jackson—didn't need flashy tech to enchant us. Whether wielding a smartphone or a shiny DSLR, clarity reigns supreme. Let the atmosphere—natural light, that is—bathe your scene in a warm embrace. The world wants to see, to feel.

Our friend Jeremy once shared his secret—a $15 clip-on microphone provided the clarity his video endeavors needed, ensuring his voice didn't drown beneath deafening silence. Simple, yet effective.

The lesson? Apples don't have to fall far from trees to taste sweet.

### Step 4: Edit Like a Pro, Even When You're Not

Editing—that is where magic alchemy occurs. Editing suites turn awkward pauses into comedic pauses, stumbling blocks into stylistic statements. With tools at our disposal—those available both freely and for nominal fees—a novice filmmaker could edit like a Steven Spielberg.

Remember Lucy? Enthusiasm personified, she spent hours hunched over her laptop, fervently tweaking her baking montage until the soufflé rose, figuratively and literally. Fast-forwards, time-lapses, scenic cuts—they don't just keep attention; they manufacture excitement. Remember to save often—every creator's guiding mantra.

### Step 5: Seal the Deal with a Call to Action

The climax! Our starry-eyed audience, awash with emotion, stands ready. This is where potential translates into reality; it's time to seal the proverbial deal. A call to action (CTA) should sprinkle its hypnotic magic within every video. Encourage viewers to embark on their next step—it's more encouragement, less desperation.

We ponder Yasmine's courageous call—to explore her eco-friendly skincare line, built on gentle whispers and soft melodies, capturing an essence both ethereal and tangible.

The CTA? A poetic note—a touch of encouragement for the soul.

## The Joy of Sharing: Distributing Your Video

What's a tale unsung if not shared? If we're to echo the kittens—from months past—their antics were measured in virality, amplified via platforms only 'til recently unthinkable. After your masterpiece is polished and ready, let it go—free it into the wild, chaotic interwebs.

**Social Media:** Our world, interconnected through blips and beeps, awaits. Each platform—Instagram, Facebook, TikTok—calls uniquely, so choose wisely your stage. Consider context; what may dazzle on YouTube, for example, may struggle against TikTok's swift current.

**Email Campaigns:** In the echoes of our network’s chatter, lies untapped potential—email subscribers, remember them? Craft an email forged with excitement, embedded with that shining video, a story bound for their screens, bound for their hearts. 

**Product Pages:** Every product page a canvas, add our video to the tapestry—oh, how it breathes life. Watch it weave its tale through wry smirks and knowing nods. 

A journey traversed is a journey shared.

## Conclusion: Navigating, Growing, Connecting

Together, we embarked upon this vibrant tapestry—an illustrious saga of pixels, passion, and endless possibilities. Through every chord of creativity, through discovery boundless—each flicker of candlelight across our screens—video marketing in harmony with our BigCommerce store emerged.

And as we, the humble creators, cast our nets into the vast sea of digital prospects, we are no longer spectators but conduits of tales untold. Streaming with purpose, uniting with our audience on a most human level, creating memories one frame at a time.

Remember, it's just the beginning. We are dreamers and doers, storytellers and innovators—and our tale is but an ever-unfolding masterpiece.
