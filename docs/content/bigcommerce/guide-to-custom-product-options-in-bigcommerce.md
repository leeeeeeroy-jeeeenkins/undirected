# Guide To Custom Product Options In BigCommerce

Ah, BigCommerce. Just hearing the name brings a fond, nostalgic smile to my face. It was a balmy Saturday afternoon, my coffee was getting cold on my cluttered desk, cats were frolicking on my keyboard because why wouldn’t they, when the idea of customizing product options struck me like a rogue lightning bolt in clear skies. It wasn’t just about listing a product; it was about becoming the modern artisan, the Picasso of eCommerce, offering a palette of choices to our discerning digital clientele.

I had realized that selling items as-is was fine—plain vanilla okay—but giving customers the power to choose, tweak, embellish, now that was the secret sauce! I imagined myself as a personal shopper for the internet, and suddenly the mundane task of setting up options in BigCommerce became my masterpiece in the making.

## Setting the Stage: Our Virtual Canvas

As I stared at my monitor—where I had approximately 42 tabs open, as one does—I noticed the name “Sarah,” a friend from my cereal aisle rendezvous, pop up in the chat. Sarah had nudged me into this exploratory journey, venturing into custom options after her custom coffee mugs took off like hotcakes. She wore her “I love spreadsheets” t-shirt, perhaps without the irony intended.

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty dance of setup, let's stretch our minds to comprehend why custom product options can set your BigCommerce store apart from the humdrum multitude. Custom options are like the cherry on top, or the unforeseen plot twist—adding not just value but personality. Imagine a customer wanting a monogrammed mug for their quirky aunt or a specific hue for their widgets—a simple touch of customization can turn a one-time buyer into a loyal fan. 

Picture us, you and I, walking through this virtual store together, showcasing the art of adding choices—a word that sparks joy to some, a terror to others. Let’s plan this excursion as gently as Sarah shares her latest organic kombucha recipe.

### Step 1: Your Control Center Awaits

When we logged into BigCommerce for the first time? It was like entering a digital theme park; a bit overwhelming, tables of data and all that. Our dashboard was like a control room with switches and buttons—a spaceport for products. Navigate to **Products**, then the **View** section. We could almost hear the pages flip to our digital register.

Sarah always said, “Like prepping your kitchen, get your products ready,” and so, ensuring everything is neat and accessible, click on the product you want to take to the next level of customization.

### Step 2: Options Like No Other

The air hums with potential. Under the **Product Options** section, we click on **Create Option**. This is where the canvas turns impressionist. Sarah was buzzing with ideas—color options for decals were one thing, but size, material, and even a bespoke message, they could literally spell out personality.

- **Option Name:** Give it a title—one as charming as possible.
- **Display Type:** Between swatches, dropdowns, or radio buttons, oh my! Pick what feels right like choosing an outfit for the day.

Sarah likened this process to a game of dress-up but for your products. And each choice we added? It felt like granting superpowers to ordinary objects.

### Step 3: Option Set Wizardry

Let’s gather our option spells into a grimoire. Back to the **Options** tab; we channel our inner wizard choosing **Create Option Set**. Select and band together what options we prepared earlier. Voila! You have an option set ready to conquer product sameness.

### Step 4: Assigning and Unleashing the Possibilities 

We were Harry and Hermione of the e-commerce world as we went back to our product, to that **Options & SKUs** tab.

1. Adorn the product with the newly forged option set.
2. Save. Like hitting “send” on an important email, it always feels final but satisfying.

And there it was—our creation, almost sentient, breathing with choice and variety that was once mundane.

## An Intricate Symphony in Setup

Sarah, with her meticulous note-taking, always reminded us it’s in the details, like the time she managed to make kombucha taste good—only because she tried 23 variations (I kid you not). An options’ detail, such as pricing adjustments or weight impacts, hide in the settings, waiting for attention. Under **SKU Options**, examining each variant unlocks these further mysteries—all adjustable to make each offering just right. 

But be warned, mistakes are the spice of life—they teach—but while here, a wrong click and our harmonious product range could sound discordant. Sarah once said she cherished her little e-commerce “oops stories,” calling them character-building episodes.

## The Joy of Discovery

Every click, every setting change, felt like an unspoken dance, a silent dialogue between creator and platform. Our products now flaunted their versatility while our customers interacted with them more; it was like hosting a gallery opening every day. We watched orders increased with varieties chosen much like guests at buffet lines, exploring delightfully, a mutual whimsy.

BigCommerce, if anything, reminded us of a curious friend—inviting us to explore, sometimes tease, always there for new adventures. Our products now teased the public eye with choices unexpected, yet requested—infusing user curiosity into our daily business grind.

Isn’t it exhilarating to create something living, something impactful? With every customization, your business bridges hearts and screens, making itself a personal aspect of another’s day. Here at BigCommerce, amid our digital labyrinths and coding spells, simplicity hides in plain sight allowing us to be artists and magicians of our tales.

Much like our journey through these product options, my tea—long since cold—could eagerly twist into something new. Maybe a Jägermeister splash next time or a hint of cinnamon. Life, after all, is best lived with options.

Amid our shared moments and coding mishaps, we've crafted possibility from potential. I hope this guide inspires you to paint your BigCommerce canvas with voracity, creativity, and maybe just a little dose of humor. Caroline from support would appreciate it.

Just remember, customize not for customization itself but to offer your products as an experience, an adventure that echoes with every customer's choice—and in a way, becomes creations of their own. Let us embark, one option at a time.

And with this, we close our vivid expedition with BigCommerce. Now, go forth, and create something wonderfully, uniquely yours.
