# The Must Have BigCommerce Apps and Integrations for ECommerce Success

Let me take you back to early 2020. It’s a place where we all had our eyes on a slightly blurry vision of an online store, believing it might just be the next big thing – akin to finding the perfect slice of pizza in a city renowned for its bagels. We spent countless nights – fueled by caffeine and unwavering optimism – trying to figure out how to make this digital dream work. And somewhere between our 97th and 98th Google search about eCommerce, it hit us: BigCommerce was where we needed to be. But not just BigCommerce by itself – we needed a band of trusty sidekicks, the BigCommerce apps and integrations that would transform our little digital corner shop into a bustling online emporium.

As we undertook this journey, what we discovered was both profound and ridiculous. Profound in how these tools could skyrocket efficiency; ridiculous in how every Google search brought up a tangle of jargon that left us scratching our heads. Ah, the irony of trying to run an "easy" online business.

So, here we are today, to share and laugh about our eCommerce expedition and dig into the must-have BigCommerce apps that turned everything around for us in a newly-exciting, unplanned way.

## Our First Encounter with the Magic: Sales & Conversion Apps

Remember that time when Grammy received her first tablet and thought she'd hacked into the Pentagon while trying to order a book? We felt a bit like that when we discovered the realm of sales and conversion apps. Suddenly, our store had a sense of flow, charm, and dare we say, pizzazz! We tried out several gimmicks before landing on ones that actually worked:

### 1. **Shogun Page Builder**
Just like the first time you successfully constructed a perfectly symmetrical Lego house—simple yet utterly satisfying—Shogun lets you drag and drop visual elements without needing to crack open a guidebook on coding languages. With this tool, we felt an exhilarating rush of creativity, as if we'd just painted a masterpiece (only digital and less messy).

### 2. **Klaviyo**
Klaviyo was like meeting a charming class valedictorian who, against all odds, was also nice and not the least bit arrogant. With its email marketing capabilities, audience segmentation, and data-driven advice, it felt like receiving a treasure map—and the gold was, you guessed it, better customer engagement.

Imagine our store: a virtual bazaar filled with uncannily familiar faces because *Klaviyo* helped us remember the names, favorite dishes, and quirky habits of our clientele.

## Riding Through the Wilderness of Inventory & Order Management

As our orders started resembling a steady river rather than sporadic rain, Liz, our relatable voice of reason, suggested we explore inventory management like sailors looking for the North Star. Navigating this landscape without proper tools was like trying to collect water in a sieve. Dry chaos.

### 3. **TradeGecko**
We never thought we'd “ooh” and “aah” over an inventory management system, but TradeGecko proved us wrong. There’s something immensely satisfying about knowing exactly how much of what is where (without sifting through sticky notes or our aptly nicknamed “notepocalypse”).

TradeGecko was a dance of precision and elegance – watching inventory align so seamlessly felt like watching synchronized swimmers at the Summer Olympics. And we became more like swans in this context, gracefully gliding instead of thrashing about in confusion.

### 4. **ShipStation**
Ah, ShipStation, the captain of our shipping fleet. It anticipated every choppy wave—the lost order or the misplaced address—before they swept us off our feet. Now, when we package an order and print a label with the satisfying hum of a well-oiled machine, we almost hear Captain Kirk's "Engage." We delight in witnessing a once muddled array of delivery mishaps transform into a well-conducted orchestration of shipping efficiency.

## The Hidden Gems: Customer Service & Experience Enhancers

As more visitors ambled through our digital aisles, we realized it couldn't just be about buying or selling anymore. We'd need to charm them, make them want to stay for teatime and biscuits, figuratively speaking. Here’s where we found our toolkit of customer service marvels:

### 5. **Yotpo**
‘Social Proof’ is a term flung around like confetti at a celebration. It’s flashy but when bundled with continuous emails urging "try us now" it can be outright underwhelming. Enter Yotpo: a proper party game-changer that encouraged reviews in a non-intrusive, rather delightful way. People began sharing their experiences all because Yotpo gently nudged them in that direction.

Our shop began to collect stories—not sales pitches—from real customers. Tales of the ceramic mugs that brought a hint of cheerful nostalgia, or how our wool scarves chased away winter blues. It was storytelling—and connection—that sold, not just products.

### 6. **Zendesk**
We fondly remember that period we dubbed "email pandemonium," where customer inquiries flooded our inboxes faster than we could say 'unsubscribe.' Enter Zendesk, efficient and timely as clockwork, which gracefully transformed chaos into the productivity of seamless communication.

Through Zendesk, we established an avenue for conversations rather than one-off questions. Engaging with customers started feeling less like a task and more like an opportunity – unexpectedly fulfilling and profoundly simple, like a well-brewed cup of tea.

## Financial Fluency: Payment & Accounting Automatons

Now, talking about finance is akin to discussing a bland oatmeal breakfast, yet the right tools can sprinkle in the metaphorical brown sugar. Among our discoveries, this sweetened the ordeal:

### 7. **QuickBooks Online**
The aromatic fresh-baked bread of our success was managing taxes and invoicing—aligned like constellations—thanks to QuickBooks Online. In essence, it kept us from losing our minds to an accountant's labyrinth of intricacies. With a ‘click-click here, calculate there’ approach, we sailed through bookkeeping.

### 8. **Stripe**
Handling transactions was without fuss with Stripe, the culinary equivalent of a Swiss Army knife: all-inclusive, filling, and ready for anything. An intuitive, seamless payment gateway changed our experience from chewing on nails worrying about security to simply and serenely watching payments make their way into our coffers.

## Culminating Experience

As we untangle this tale, I can't help but think—working with these integrations was like hiring a star-studded team to transform our moderate theatrical play into an enchanting Broadway production. Each one played their unique part, harmonizing to fuel our eCommerce dreams.

And just like a campfire story, I believe the magic of these integrations lies in the sharing. So take this trove of knowledge, and perhaps you'll find your own particular mix of BigCommerce allies to pair with your entrepreneurial quest.

Let’s keep exploring, keep discovering, and, importantly, let's keep laughing together as we dive ever deeper into this boundless digital sea.

So what about you, friends? What BigCommerce apps are you using that bring harmonious balance to your day-to-day whirlwind? Let's swap stories and keep pushing this eCommerce adventure forward.
