# How To Improve Site Speed On BigCommerce

Once upon a time in the digital realm of entrepreneurial adventures, we stumbled upon a peculiar puzzle: my BigCommerce store. It was a metaphorical tortoise in an era where everyone loved hares—clients abandoned their shopping carts faster than I could say "optimized image." And so, armed with an insatiable curiosity and a disheartened bounce rate, we embarked on a journey to expedite our pixelated domain.

## The Day We Discovered Google PageSpeed Insights

I remember a particular afternoon when Mark, my tech-savvy friend who swears by single-origin coffee, pointed me toward Google PageSpeed Insights. "This," he declared with a glint in his eye, "is where the magic happens." The tool, much like an insightful oracle, assessed our page's performance and reiterated our worst suspicions: we were slower than molasses in January.

### Step 1: Leverage Browser Caching

Mark was fond of analogies and compared our site's woes to a seeping teapot—everything was leaking out slowly but surely. He suggested tweaking our browser caching. In the `BigCommerce` control panel, navigate to **Advanced Settings** and find your way to **Caching**. Check the boxes like candy at checkout - a nod to longer expiration times for static resources. Suddenly, our teapot, metaphorically speaking, sealed up its leaks.

### Step 2: Optimize and Compress Images

Next came the visual weightlifting challenge. Images, lovingly crafted but hefty like holiday hubbub, needed slimming. Using a tool like `TinyPNG` or `JPEGmini`, we reduced file sizes without losing an iota of image quality. Then, with ninja-like agility, we uploaded these newfound featherweights back onto our BigCommerce realm.

### Step 3: Minimize JavaScript and CSS

Mark's caffeine-fueled brain likened JavaScript to the unsung hero of a circus troupe—holding everything together but, when overextended, causing chaos. We employed minification: shrinking code files by eliminating whitespaces and comments. Tools like UglifyJS and CSSNano became our loyal sidekicks, compressing our files like a well-trained vacuum packer.

Here's how we did it:

1. **Navigate to your theme’s files**: In BigCommerce, swing over to **Storefront** and tap on **Script Manager**.
2. **Identify bulky scripts** and slim them down using online CSS/JS minification tools.
3. **Upload and test**: After minifying, load them back to see the newfound agility of your store.

### Step 4: Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Imagine Santa distributing gifts without a sleigh—that was us, before the CDN revelation. We configured our BigCommerce store to partner with a CDN, distributing content blissfully across global servers. BigCommerce comes with its own Akamai CDN—check it's enabled under the **Store Setup > Image Manager**. If not, click through, enable it, and feel the sleigh take off.

### Step 5: Reduce HTTP Requests

By now, we were on a roll—practically seasoned web speed architects. But there was one hitch, the labyrinthine network of HTTP requests. We rolled up our sleeves and consolidated CSS and JavaScript files, combining where possible to reduce these digital handshakes.

### Step 6: Enable AMP for Mobile

Another cloudy Tuesday, Mark, ever the bearer of solutions, introduced me to AMP—accelerated mobile pages, a transformative project that Google loves like its own offspring. BigCommerce makes this easy. Head to **Storefront > Script Manager**, and with a few toggle switches, your mobile site will find its own speed superpowers.

### Step 7: Review Third-Party Apps

As the digital snow cleared, we reviewed third-party apps. Many were well-intentioned but, in reality, they sat like unused gym memberships—cluttering our space and weighing us down. Deactivation became an art form, harmonizing functionality with necessity, removing what wasn’t essential for our site's operations.

## The Charmed Results

Weeks later, sipping a celebratory green tea, Mark and I gazed at the screen elated. Our site's loading time plummeted—almost half of what it had been, like a nimble dancer catching the rhythm. The reported change was not just numbers; it manifested in customer engagement, seemingly lifting the overall user experience —a digital dream turned reality.

## The Call to Keep Learning

Through this journey, we learned that optimizing site speed wasn't a one-time fix but an ongoing dance with technology, always seeking to delight users quickly and efficiently. No experience richer than the one shared and celebrated in good company.

As we sat there, marveling at how a string of steps—and perhaps a bit too much caffeine—transformed our sluggish site to a sprightly performer, there was one truth clearer than HD: Every BigCommerce store deserves to be quick, loved by its keepers and users alike.

Here’s to your journey, steered by determination and dashes of delight. Happy optimizing!
