# Using BigCommerce Blog To Boost Organic Traffic

I remember the first time we stumbled upon the importance of blog content for driving website traffic. It was a crisp autumn day, and we were sipping a particularly disappointing instant coffee on a patio at Steve's, debating just how exactly to get more eyes on our struggling ice cream business website. My partner—with the enthusiasm of someone who had just discovered an extra scoop of cookie dough hidden in the bottom of their cone—suggested, "What if we just, you know, write a blog? Everyone's doing it!" At first, I was skeptical, my inner cynic imagining a slew of words flitting off into the digital void, unnoticed and unloved. But that simple idea turned out to be the key to unlocking new heights of visibility—our traffic numbers soared. In the heart of relentless searches, we were found.

## The First Scoop: Understanding Why Blogs Matter

Every major content platform touts the virtues of blogging for traffic, but it wasn't until our own humble attempts started drawing in curious readers that we began to really see its power. Blogs are the storytelling arm of your digital presence—the sunlit window that lets the fresh aroma of your brand waft out into the unseen yet always bustling marketplace that is the internet.

In our journey, we saw our simple articles transform into virtual breadcrumbs that led readers—almost subconsciously like following a melodic tune—straight to our digital doorstep. Once there, visitors couldn't help but marvel at the smorgasbord of flavors we had to offer, which eventually piqued their curiosity enough to convert into customers.

## Setting the Stage: Creating a BigCommerce Blog

Embarking on this digital expedition feels daunting at first—like looking at a 5,000-piece puzzle of a candy store. But the beauty of BigCommerce is its ease, extending an inviting hand to both seasoned e-commerce professionals and novices alike. Let's break it down.

1. **Log into Your BigCommerce Account**

   It’s simple—once you're in, it's like strolling into your own personal digital workspace. You'll start from the 'Dashboard'. This is your command center, where we begin our delightful endeavor.

2. **Navigate to Content**

   Look for the 'Storefront' section, a little bridge between what the site can be and what it already is. Under the 'Storefront' tab, you'll see 'Web Pages'—this is where you'll set up that all-important blog page.

3. **Create a New Blog Page**

   Here’s where the real fun begins—you're the artist, and this is your canvas. Select 'Create a Web Page' and from the 'Page Type' section, choose 'Blog'.

4. **Customize Your Blog**

   You'll want to decorate your space with stories and insights that invite people in. Title this page something snappy, intriguing—'Stories from the Cold Cones'—well, maybe that's just one idea. In the 'URL/Page Link' section, ensure that the URL is simple yet representative of the tales you'll share.

5. **Add Content to Your Blog**

   The meat—and potatoes—of any blog is, of course, irresistible content. "Content Is King," as they say, which always sounded incredibly regal. Start with an inviting introductory post, something that says, "Welcome, friend. We have much to share."

## Stirring the Imagination: Crafting Compelling Content

The beauty of a blog is how it lets us become digital raconteurs. Our tales—about behind-the-scenes peeks of our ice cream adventures to sharing unexpected flavors we've stumbled upon—became the secret sauce to our organic recipe. 

Writing isn’t just putting pen to paper, or fingers to keyboard; it’s about shaping words with playful, unapologetic creativity. Whether you're recounting the time the freezer went haywire, or your first attempt at creating licorice ice cream, make it personal—delve into the raw and the genuine. Authenticity engages, not perfection.

## Dusting with SEO: Sprinkling Words With Care

We quickly learned the importance of SEO—search engine optimization—a concept as intimidating as trying to fix the ice cream machine when it went on the fritz. But when we boiled it down, it was simply about understanding the language of search engines and using it wisely as we would with a pinch of salt in a bowl of cookie dough.

1. **Keywords and Phrases**

   Think of them as old friends, words and phrases you know your audience loves. Incorporate them naturally into your text—slugging them in like secret ingredients.

2. **Meta Descriptions**

   These are your blog’s shop window—craft them with flair to invite searchers in. If they're akin to those exquisitely tempting hand-painted signs in storefronts, oh boy, wouldn't clicks follow?

3. **Internal and External Links**

   Linking turns your words into a connected neural network, like cross-referencing different flavors on our menu. Guide your readers to related content on your site or credible sources elsewhere—thus endearing you to search engines.

## An Invitation to Engage: Fostering a Community

Our readers soon became our friends; some even reached out with comments and questions that turned into long threads of conversation. Encouraging this kind of engagement—direct reply from the blog comments—reminded us of how visitors walking into the store would sample, chat, and often return with friends in tow.

Promote sharing—place conveniently placed buttons for your puppet masters, social media—is like flipping the OPEN sign on your store to the world. Foster discussion by responding and engaging with your commenters. When your visitors see you valuing their input, they become part of the narrative. And that's pure gold.

## Measuring Success: Checking the Pulse of Your Blog

Every good venture deserves to be checked and cross-checked. We sat by as our analytics told stories of their own—traffic spikes like summer short lines, returning visitors, and pages that had more conversations than a bustling book club.

1. **Analytics Tools**

   Dive deep into the analysis with tools like Google Analytics. It’s akin to counting scoops served; translates traffic, bounce rate, and user engagement into digestible data.

2. **Adapting Your Strategy**

   Just as tastes can change with the seasons, keep an eye on patterns—adjust when necessary, like pivoting the day you decided to try poppyseed pineapple swirls mid-summer.

## Bringing It Full Circle

Looking back, the choice to use our BigCommerce blog was like deciding to add real vanilla beans to cream instead of vanilla flavoring—it enriched everything. From connecting with our audience to climbing that irksome hill of organic traffic, it was an odyssey worth every step. And though the internet might feel like a vast, cold frontier, our blog became a warm corner basking in the glow of community—a place where our stories see the light of day.

There's something comforting about knowing our words have found a home on the screens—and in the minds—of others. So there you have it—our curt, whimsical, and oh-so-human approach to using a BigCommerce blog for bolstering organic traffic. Should you find yourself on the cusp of this journey, grab a cup of that lukewarm instant brew with a friend as we did, and embark; some journeys are sweeter than the tallest sundae.
