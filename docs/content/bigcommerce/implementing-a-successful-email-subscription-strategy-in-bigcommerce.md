# Implementing A Successful Email Subscription Strategy In BigCommerce

Growing up, my grandma's kitchen always smelled like fresh-baked cookies. We’d sit together at the table, me fiddling with my paper and pencils, her, sipping her tea with an ease that seemed to defy time itself. She told me stories that were rich and vivid, but what stood out were those humble recipes – full of details like “a splash of this” or “a pinch of that” – secrets whispered in the language of love. Now, those same cookies remind me of the power of attention to detail and how it makes all the difference, especially when maneuvering through the mysterious labyrinth of BigCommerce email subscription strategy.

## Discovering the Ingredients

Remember the time when Uncle Joe tried his hand at baking, thinking he could nail the cookies by just tossing in ingredients, skipping my grandma’s treasured process? Spoiler: the result was charred hockey pucks. A haphazard approach never prospers, and just like baking, curating our email subscription strategy for BigCommerce depends on getting those first steps right.

Begin by logging in to your BigCommerce store, warmly inviting yourself into the dashboard where dreams are either nurtured or rudely dismantled. If only this login welcomed us with cookies.

Next, we move to **’Marketing’** in the left-hand bar – it’s akin to reaching for that flour jar in grandma's kitchen. Click on **’Email Marketing’**, and here the magic begins. Hover over the word ‘campaigns’ like you’d linger over the cookie dough – with curiosity and ambition.

Now, let's not forget our instruments of marvel, the email campaigns, need exquisite form and substance. To create them, click on **’Create Campaign’**. Input those little nuggets of ingenuity in the form fields: name, subject line – keep them honest and inviting.

## Mixing the Elements

There we were, sitting around the table, and Grandma started sharing how a perfect blend of ingredients is the heart and soul of her cookies. Likewise, our email subscription strategy requires a seamless blend of elements to entice and excite.

Personalization, my friends, is where the conversation starts. In this digital age, where everyone's inbox feels like Times Square on NYE – loud and crowded – addressing recipients by their first name is like tapping them on the shoulder amidst the bustle, whispering, “Hey, this one’s just for you.”

We dive into BigCommerce's segment tools which let us cordially group our subscribers based on their tastes and preferences – an orchestration of data like the medley of chocolate chips and raisins in our cookie mix. Select **’Customer Groups’** and relish in your power to segregate – thoughtfully, with care.

Offering value is our brand’s way of adding sugar and spice – be it in the form of exclusive offers or delightful tips. Believe me, we are the wise old confidant who drops nuggets of wisdom in those letters. Use dynamic content to ensure each mail is unique, a hallmark of its recipient. Do explore Liquid templating in BigCommerce by wrapping your email body with back ticks to add those conditional statements. Well, `welcome_email` shall be personalized far beyond the realms of generic.

```
{% if subscriber.first_name %}
  Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},
{% else %}
  Hey there,
{% endif %}
```

## Letting it Rise

Alas, now our mixture basks in a patient wait, gradually crisping to perfection inside the oven – a delicate symphony of heat, chemistry, and time. Likewise, we nurture our subscription plan to rise to its full glory with a well-timed send and authentic engagement tactics.

In our BigCommerce platform, scheduling emails isn’t just a functionality, but an artform. Quality over quantity, my friends. We explore **’Schedule Send’** – like our epic tales – extending the joyous wait by setting emails to launch not on a whim, but when our audience sits comfortably with an open heart, and hopefully, laptop or phone.

Now, NakedHenry from the Fireship YouTube channel, a maestro of unpredictability, suggests randomized send patterns. We may sometimes throw in a sweet surprise as Grandma did with an unexpected cookie batch on a drab Tuesday afternoon. Keep recipients on their digital toes.

And to breathe the warmth of human touch, quick responses to replies and feedback become our metaphorical soft cookies, hot out of the oven, waiting to be relished. Nothing beats that freshly made interaction.

## Enjoying the Batch

Like savoring the melody of cookies coming out just right, relish that moment when your subscription numbers grow, reflecting a strategy well-baked. The rewards lie in a journey well-paved, delightful and fragrant throughout.

Don’t forget to track your performance with BigCommerce’s reporting tools. Click on **’Reports’** and discover detailed stats on open rates, click-throughs, and those silent unsung heroes – the unsubscribes. We honor the departure of each unsatisfied palate and strive to enhance our recipe for the next batch. Tracking isn't babysitting, it's refining the baker's craft.

Our endeavors, similar to my Grandma’s kitchen tales, are stories well-woven, full of love, detail, and personalization, meant to engage and nurture loyalty. We aren’t just emailing; we’re crafting memories that stick.

As we close this nostalgic tale, let our BigCommerce email subscription strategy live, breathe, and lure subscribers like grandma’s cookies – full of heart, authenticity, and that irresistible craving for more.
