# Developing A Content Strategy For BigCommerce

## Finding Our Groove

Remember when we decided, out of nowhere, to start our own little digital shop on BigCommerce? Seems like yesterday. Our living room was bursting with sketchbooks, half-nibbled pencils, and post-its peppered with ‘eureka’ ideas. Jazz from an old Miles Davis record wafted through the house as we embarked on a quest no less epic than Frodo’s journey to Mordor: creating a content strategy. And not just any content strategy, mind you, but one tailored and fitted to BigCommerce, akin to a bespoke suit – sharp enough to cut through the digital noise.

It was Sara, with her penchant for research, who struck gold first. She stumbled upon a nifty guide on customer personas. This would be the birth of our illustrious strategy. What were people like us searching for? Who were these mysterious buyers? And why were they buying? We brewed some oversized mugs of coffee and set out to discover more.

## Who Are We Speaking To?

The very first step feels like the dumpling grandma used to make – the perfect mix of essential ingredients. We grabbed some pens and scribbled down audience specifics: their dreams, their fears, their late-night internet searches. We wanted to know if the skateboarding teens were looking for the latest deck designs, or maybe skate shoes that matched their cosmic vibe. This wasn’t just market research; it was an archeological dig into the minds and hearts of our customers.

Creating those personas wasn't just filling out a stereotype form. It was more like creating a character in a novel. “Do they drink carrot juice or guzzle energy drinks?” We laughed at that one but noted it down anyway. Who knew it would come handy? Our content had to speak to them as if we were long-lost friends.

## The Map of Our Stories

After we knew our audience perfectly – like you’d know the way home from your favorite coffee shop – it was time for the content journey, not unlike those beautiful, uncharted maps in fantasy novels. Wandering aimlessly around doesn’t get us very far. We needed a plan cleverly devised, a schema of sorts. Step one: brainstorming potential topics. We sprinted through ideas like caffeine-fueled gazelles, quickly scribing down each one as if it were a golden ticket to Willy Wonka’s factory.

This method involved heart and soul, and sometimes an extra scoop of ice cream, but it was simple: What do our personas want to know? What stories could we share that resonate with their tales? We had our eyes firmly on the horizon - the possibilities were endless.

## Content Calendar: Our Compass

If our topics were our maps, the content calendar was our compass. It guided us through unknown waters. Each date, a new adventure. We swam through publishing schedules, ticking off tasks with the satisfaction of completing a particularly challenging jigsaw puzzle.

"Every piece has its place," Sara said. And it certainly did. Holidays, seasons, these were more than dates. They were opportunities. Opportunities to connect with others in a meaningful way. To maybe, just maybe, capture lightning in a bottle – even if only for a moment.

## Crafting the Words

Writing is a dance, and sometimes, we’d trip over our own clumsy feet. We’d stumble – or stomp perhaps – but when the rhythm was right, it felt like flying. Each blog, product description, and email was a melody that needed arranging, so we polished, we tweaked, until every note was in tune.

A dash of humor – sharp enough to catch attention without cutting too deep – and a sprinkle of wisdom – just enough to spark intrigue and inspiration. This was storytelling at its finest; a bridge between commerce and the values that wove our fabric.

### Example: A Product Description

Remember our quirky skateboard line? Those weren’t simply boards. They were companions for midnight rides and confidence badges for those daring enough to embrace vertigo. Describing them involved more than technical specs. It was crafting a narrative: “Explore the Universe. One kickflip at a time.”

```plaintext
Introducing the Cosmic Cruiser - your ticket to ride interstellar winds. With precision bearings and a galaxy of designs, the Cosmic Cruiser takes you where your imagination dares. Grip it, flip it, dream it.
```

We wanted the words to leap off the page, spin dreams, and plant seeds of imagination. The subtle blend of practicality and whimsy was our forte by then.

## Engagement and Connection

Halfway through our journey, we discovered it wasn't enough to simply launch content into the ether. Cue introspection and sniffles as we learned the importance of dialogue–genuine conversations in the form of comments, shares, and likes. “Engagement.” The word slipped from our tongues often, alongside our beloved coffee mugs. It wasn't long before feedback loops became our favorite dance moves.

Seeing our audience – they of carrot juice or energy drink affinity – connect with the narrative left us giddy, like children on a sugar high. Each response was an echo that completed our symphony, validating the countless hours of content creation.

## Measuring and Reevaluating

Statistics wasn’t high on our list of favorite things—no offense to all the number lovers out there! But those figures, charts, and percentages became another brushstroke in our ongoing masterpiece. Our friend Dan, who may or may not work in advanced algorithms, helped us untangle the web of analytics. Together, we delved into what resonated, what floundered, and how to tweak until the melody rang true.

This data-driven feedback was akin to a lighthouse. No longer drifting, we had direction—swift corrective maneuvers towards growth, improvement, and next steps. Our BigCommerce strategy was becoming more refined by the day.

## Looking Back and Moving Forward

As the saying goes, every end is a new beginning. We’d come full circle, learning and creating. Our little string of digital adventures was not just a shop. It was an expression, an outlet, a narrative that sailed through the screens into people’s lives.

Looking forward, our story continues. We’re on a bright path, one lit with laughter, creativity, and perhaps a little bit of Miles Davis in the background. Here’s to the narrative yet to be written, the content yet to be crafted, the strategies yet to unfold. Remember, it’s more than business. It’s the journey that counts.
