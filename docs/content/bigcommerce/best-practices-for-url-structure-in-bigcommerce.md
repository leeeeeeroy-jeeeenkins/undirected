# Best Practices for URL Structure in BigCommerce

About a year ago, I found myself in the labyrinthine corridors of the internet, desperately trying to unravel the mysteries of URL structures on BigCommerce. I remember it vividly. It was a rainy Tuesday afternoon, and the world smelled of petrichor — beautiful word, right? I had just downed my third cup of coffee when it struck me like an errant frisbee: our online store's URLs were a cluttered mess, more tangled than outdated Christmas lights.

Let me tell you, navigating the complexities of URL structure felt like deciphering hieroglyphics with sunglasses on. Yet, in the chaos, there was opportunity. Because, dear friends, URL structures can make or break an ecommerce venture. The very soul of your site — its navigational architecture — rests upon them. So, how about we journey together through this swirling sea of what works and what doesn't? Are you with me on this one?

## Why URLs Matter

I should've realized URLs were the unsung heroes of web navigation sooner. They’re like the GPS coordinates for your online treasure. Once, my buddy Steve said, “URLs are like the Dewey Decimal System for libraries.” Thank you, Steve, for the librarian's take. With clean URLs, search engines love us more, and our users can find things easier too — it's win-win. 

When URLs are done right, they exude simplicity and exude elegance like a world-class athlete. They should contain as much information as needed, and can even be pretty — well, at least not butt-ugly. Here's the secret sauce: Keep them relevant and readable. The gobbledygook of random characters? Toss it out. Let’s forge paths that even the search bots can follow with precision, like a bloodhound on a hot scent. Trust us, they'll notice.

## Simplicity is Elegance

Picture this: it's a beautiful Saturday morning, birds are chirping, and you’re building a URL. Like a maestro composing an aria, every stroke broadening the canvas. Simplicity, my dear reader, is our north star. I remember an exuberant afternoon I spent just trying to undo the knot of a bloated URL string, like an endless ball of twine. It wasn’t pretty.

Here's our mantra: keep it simple. It’s akin to making a sandwich — everybody loves an accessible one. Imagine URLs as brief, concise headlines that make you nod comfortably. They ought to not resemble the unabridged dictionary.

### Traits of a Simple URL

A few more nuggets of wisdom:
- **Use hyphens** between words. It’s like holding hands — they keep everything together. Let’s ditch the underscores, all in favor say aye!
- **Lowercase letters** — why complicate life? Don't wrestle with capitals.
- **Avoid special characters** as they’re like unsavory party crashers. They just don’t belong — simple as pie.

## The Art of Keywords

Back when I was navigating my own BigCommerce maze, keywords felt elusive — like trying to catch a sunbeam in a jar. But we all know they are the key (pun intended) to SEO supremacy. Integrate these gems wisely.

Consider them as breadcrumbs for our digital Hansels and Gretels, guiding users and crawlers to the gingerbread house of our offerings. These aren't some clandestine signals; they're unmissable beacons.

### Placement and Usage

Once I spent an entire morning arguing with my cousin Martin about keyword placement in URLs. Yeah, right, who does that? Turns out, location matters. Like a beachside view, you want keywords up front. Not buried in the garden shed, but prominently greeting like an eager concierge.

## Avoiding Overcrowding

It was on a dreary evening, gripping a mug of tea, when it dawned on me: like enthusiastic hoarders, we might stuff everything into a URL. Big mistake. It’s tempting, isn’t it? But restraint, friends, is key. 

Crowding a URL with information is akin to stuffing a pizza with every topping in the deli. Sure, it’s fun, but eventually, it morphs into an indigestible concoction. Let’s keep our URLs zen-like — serene, uncluttered, undeniably digestible.

## Consistency Over Chaos

Remember Emma, from our marketing team? You know how she always matches her socks to her hat? That’s consistency — and our URLs should have the same fashion sense. I stumbled upon inconsistency once, and it was more disconcerting than mismatched woolens.

### Steps to Achieve Uniform URLs in BigCommerce

Ah, the practical part! To keep URLs consistent in BigCommerce, here’s how we do it:

1. **Navigate to Store Setup**: First, cradle that mug of enthusiasm and head over to BigCommerce’s Store Setup.
2. **Go to Store Settings**: It’s the digital equivalent of arranging your sock drawer.
3. **SEO Tab**: Click on the SEO tab — feels sophisticated, right? 
4. **Custom URL Structure**: Time for some creativity. Set up custom URL structures according to the product, category, and pages.
5. **Apply Consistent Naming**: Craft these with love and consistency. Like an artist crafting their oeuvre.

## Avoiding Needless Redirects

Ah, redirects, my old frenemy. There we were, once upon a cold winter night, having a showdown with unnecessary redirects on our BigCommerce site. Every extra redirect feels like a detour in an adventure novel—fun for some, frustrating for others. The ideal? Straight paths, clear as crystal.

Avoid using redirects unless absolutely necessary. The magic happens when URLs are self-sufficient, guiding visitors seamlessly like an elegant waltz.

## Closing Thoughts

Now that we've arrived at what feels like the Summit of Everest, in our URL expedition—bespite not having frostbite—I’m reminded of one fact: crafting proper URL structures in BigCommerce is an art and a science. To capture the imagination of users and please the dutiful crawlers of search engines, our URLs must speak eloquently. They should be clean, consistent, and contain the melody of relevant keywords.

Our journey together today was but a beginning. Made up of experiences, misunderstandings, captures of clarity, and laughter—yes, let's not forget that. It reminds me of the time I attempted to name our URL structure after movie titles, purely for amusement, only to realize it made the SEO team laugh but sent the bots in a dizzying loop. Lesson learned, folks.

Let us cultivate our URL garden with care, ensuring visitors and algorithms alike find solace and clarity in their journey. Cheers to creating our digital pathfinders with care and consideration, spiced with a hint of humor and a delight for discovery. Adventure awaits!
