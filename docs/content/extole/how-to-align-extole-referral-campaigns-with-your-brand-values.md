# How to Align Extole Referral Campaigns with Your Brand Values

I remember the first referral campaign our team launched with Extole as if it happened yesterday. The air was thick with anticipation – a static charge buzzing over the desks, among coffee mugs and empty snack wrappers. Emma, our cynical optimist with a penchant for plaid, was skeptically watching the dashboard from her laptop, purse-lipped and furrow-browed. "If this thing doesn't gel with our values, we're sunk," she muttered. We all nodded in silent agreement. Our brand? Not just a logo or a tagline, but an amalgamation of the ideals and promises we held dear. That moment, a boiling mix of hope and apprehension, led us to craft something uniquely ours with the tools at hand.

## Bridging Hearts and Numbers: Introducing Your Brand Values into Extole

Before taking a single step into the world of referral campaigns, we need to have that deep heart-to-heart with our brand values, much like finding the perfect pair of socks for a mismatched outfit (you know it when you see it). It was Max, our chief brainstormer and snack-hoarder, who laid out our brand manifesto on the conference table – a spidery, handwritten sheet that smelled of his lemon citrus cologne. 

### Step 1: Define and Embrace Your Brand Essence

To align our campaign, we first had to capture, in no uncertain terms, the very essence of our brand. Are we playful? Are we steadfast? Do we sing songs about sustainability to the tune of old nursery rhymes when no one's listening? Jot this down. Language is paramount, and tangibles too: the exact shade of blue that speaks to our soul, the font that’s as welcoming as our granny’s quilted hugs. Let’s not be shy in defining this. Emma would often say – only half-jokingly – "If it isn’t in your bones, people will see right through it.”

### Step 2: Set the Goal, Keep the Spirit

The goal, a lighthouse in a stormy sea, should align with our brand values. We must ask ourselves, does the purpose of this campaign contribute to our overarching mission, make our community better, or enhance the life of a single ant? Well, maybe not the last one unless ants are central to our brand. I remember we scribbled keywords on the whiteboard while arguing if community should precede engagement. Interestingly, the discussion alone unified our focus.

## Designing the Campaign Visuals

Picture it. You’re leafing through design drafts like they’re slices of caramel cake. Each morsel, uh, draft - whispers a promise and a story. Our ever-restless creative, Sam, would tap his foot while eyeing us skeptically over rimless glasses as if daring us to say his color wheel was wrong.

### Step 3: Choose Imagery that Speaks Your Brand’s Language

Images are those silent yet powerful allies. They often shout more about who we are than any paragraph could. A friend once told us her brand was ‘silent sophistication wrapped in the heartbeats of jazz.’ (Yeah, I still remember that metaphor for its chaotic randomness.) For us, imagery needed to affirm our brand without screaming in neon – unless neon was your thing, like it was for our buddy Marvin’s Retro-Electro Diner. Align your colors and aesthetic with your values. Keep it simple, but let your soul shine through.

### Step 4: Craft Copy that Resonates

Words. They're powerful. They inspire revolutions and can make Emma’s tea spill or Sam's coffee spill as it did during the great “We-need-punchier-copy” debacle of ’22. Our copy, we found out, had to straddle this fine line between tactfully persuasive and lovingly genuine. Words should mirror the promises your brand whispers at night when all seems still. Jot everything down, everything your brand wants to say to its favorite folks.

## Implementing and Evaluating the Campaign

Ah, the moment of truth – the initial click, the first referral, our hearts drumming like a tribe of enthusiastic gorillas (a kind of musical gorilla that’s somehow both soothing and galvanizing if we’re sticking to the metaphor).

### Step 5: Launch the Campaign with Decisive Care

Launching a campaign is akin to sending a ship off to sea. You’ve checked the sails, tasted the salt in the air, yet there’s a nervous excitement you can never fully shake off. We decided on a soft launch, to gauge the waters, gently reshaping as feedback drifted in. You’ll have your own preferred approach _but remember_ – what fits one, won’t fit all.

### Step 6: Listen and Adjust

Feedback poured in – like cookies fresh out of the oven. Some wore golden trophies, others were more of the burnt-crisp variety. Learning was the name of the game here. We nudged data, shifted designs, folding in community feedback until the campaign was a harmonious echo of our deepest brand beliefs. It was during this retrospective journey we discovered that collaborating with our user base brought a depth to the table we hadn’t precisely planned for, yet it greatly enriched our campaign.

### Step 7: Celebrate Your Successes (And Learn)

Reflect on what worked, what didn’t, and who asked for pineapple on pizza during a brainstorming lunch. I digress, the point is, good things often spring from unexpected places. We found our community resonated most with the initiatives we scarcely emphasized – a humbling Sphinx of discoveries.

## Syncopating New Rhythms: Constantly Realigning and Innovating

Observations led us to grow, flourish and occasionally wane, but always in sync with our brand's musicality. Max would say – hand on heart or stress ball – "It’s like tuning an orchestra that never stops." We have to always be thinking forward, considering new innovations and trends, adapting without compromising who we are.

And while this journey can feel a bit daunting among relentless gigs and spin cycles, sharing these steps helps ground the undertaking into one poignant realization: a campaign isn’t merely an extension of your brand – it’s an embodiment. Just as each one of us brings our wacky, passionate, and slightly chaotic energy into every project, so does every brand breathe life and authenticity into each campaign it shepherds into the world.

Let’s embark on this journey together, shall we – armed with nothing but our reflective minds and unwavering hearts?
