# Designing Reward Structures in Extole for Maximum Impact

Some years ago, my inbox introduced me to Extole, a referral marketing platform with a knack for being intriguing—like a well-read stranger in a coffee shop whose book cover you can't quite make out. It was one of those mornings where the Wi-Fi was spotty, and the only thing on my to-do list was to merely exist with a cup of hope, which is not coffee, but a close cousin. Someone had recommended a friend's online store to me, and that email was adorned with an arrow pointing to some health-conscious chocolate bars. That simple referral led my curiosity down a rabbit hole of building platforms for brand advocates. Before long, there I was, deep in the intricacies of designing reward structures that could transform standard transactions into fan-faithful experiences.

## The Donut Hole of Incentives

Let's chat for a minute about the artful intersections between wanting donuts and building incentive structures. It's like craving a glazed donut—simple in essence, but complex in taste if done right. We realized, over too many coffees, that deciding which reward crumbles to sprinkle requires both clever strategizing and a heart for understanding what our people loved most. The delectable goal? Make every advocate feel like an insider getting that special-day, early-morning batch.

The first step is crystal clarity. Write out your plan at dawn, when your brain is too tired to think in clichés. What do you want to achieve—realistically—and why does it matter? Is it to boost numbers, expand horizons, or create a tribe loyal as Golden Retrievers? Consider aligning rewards with our brand’s voice. Don't hand out mismatched socks to outdoor enthusiasts unless they’re the kind that warm adventures, not just toes.

### Reward Recipe

Imagine we want to reward friend referrals on Extole. We could go overboard with heaps of generosity—too much frosting—and end up in chaos. Here's the secret recipe for the ideal reward:

1. **Find the sweet spot**: Begin by deciding whether the reward will be cash, discounts, or experiences. Place value where passion resides.
  
2. **Start small, reach skyward**: Kick off with achievable tiers to seed motivation, then build upwards like we’re stacking pancakes. Each referral could unlock better rewards. Visualize it like levels in a satisfying video game—construct your own good vs. better vs. best reward hierarchy.

3. **Mix emotional & tangible**: Blend in emotional rewards, things that tickle the "yay" receptors, with tangible benefits. Recognition on social media for top referrers? Everyone likes their fleeting moment in the sunlight.

4. **Testing and tweaking**: Once you've rolled out the red carpet, stand back but remain ready. Watch, learn, and adjust. Hunt data like it’s a truffle in the competitive marketplace forest. 

## The Delightful Gumball Machine —

Flashback to us huddled over a quirky gumball machine—a curious relic from John's childhood, half-filled with tokens meant for rewarding neighborly goodness. It taught us something invaluable: the reward mechanic should feel whimsical yet dependable. The more transparent and predictable it is, the more likely people will line up to have their turn. Every pull shouldn’t be a gamble ending in a flavored miss, but rather a testament to human consistency.

Think about when grandma would send you birthday cards with a crisp bill inside. This is the feeling we're aiming for. Clear, achievable, and above all, a blast of happy chemicals—dopamine without the doom, as they say.

### Designing the Machine

Consider your brand's own gumball machine:

1. **Dependability**: Set clear goals and make sure everyone knows how many gumballs they need before they get the gleaming red one. An obvious journey breeds trust. Communicate every little detail like it's a sweet little breadcrumb leading to a magical chocolate house.

2. **Fortify with simplicity**: Someone once said, "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," and though I never remember who, they were really on to something. Simplified structures encourage participation and prevent reward fatigue.

3. **Add excitement, by degrees**: The right amount of mystery alongside solid rewards keeps your audience intrigued. Ever tried climbing a mountain where the view at each plateau is breathtaking, yet promises better horizons?

## When All Else Fails, Send Cheesecake

It was one damp afternoon in December, Carla and I mused over the idea of unconventional rewards with a slice of cheesecake, sticky paper napkins between us. We considered, ever so briefly, the oddness of treating customers as we'd treat friends with an impromptu slice of joy when they least expect it. Because sometimes, extending a 'surprise, here's a piece of delight' can be the cherry on top—or the whole dessert.

Add some fun flourishes to your Extole campaign:

- **Surprise Extras**: Think surprise bonuses beyond the regular incentive. An unexpected reward sparks elation and ripples through social connections—they’ll talk about it. Remember the cheesecake.

- **Feedback Loop**: Keep the lines open; endlessly hear and adjust to how advocates feel about rewards. It's not just for figuring out what's wrong—it's also to replicate success. Celebrate loudly, fix quietly.

## Guidelines on Gratitude

Remember the post-it notes scribbled by my side, a simple list from which this final act draws inspiration. Gratitude was at its heart—laser-focused on valuing advocates genuinely yet wholeheartedly.

- Personalize thank you notes—an art so lost but so powerful; channel your inner pen pal, add emojis if you're brave.
- Record the impact. Showing advocates the tangible difference they’ve made satisfies inner aspirations that go beyond your reward structure.

### Community Beyond Rewards

Why stop at a reward structure when there's a ripe opportunity to build community? “Building a tribe,” as we lovingly describe it at our meetings—sometimes extended lunch breaks with pizza—is instrumental for long-term affection. Invite advocates to events or forums, offering leadership roles in shaping upcoming offers. When people feel ownership, they not only stick around but help you flourish like a well-tended garden.

#### Code Example

Here’s a snippet in Python that tingles our tech-loving heartstrings to automatically send a thank you note, because who says technology can't be cuddly and efficient?

```python
def send_thank_you_email(user_email):
    subject = "Big Thank You from Our Team!"
    body = (
        f"Hi there!\n\n"
        f"Your support means the world to us, and we wanted to say a big thank you!\n"
        f"We couldn’t have made it without your help.\n\n"
        "Warm regards,\n"
        "Your Friends at Brand X"
    )
  
    email_server.send_email(recipient=user_email, subject=subject, body=body)

# simulate sending a thank you
send_thank_you_email('example@domain.com')
```

And there you have it: a touch of programming to silver-line our gratitude.

## The Farewell with a Warm Cup

As our jaunts down this narrative lane come to a conclusion, think back to that earlier encounter with Extole in my inbox—brewing ideas over a metaphorical cup of joy. Designing these structures, like crafting the most satisfying labyrinth, takes an earnest commitment to understanding the paths advocates prefer to roam and ensuring those paths are lush with rewards, personalization, and unexpected delights, much like a cup of hot chocolate on a frosty day, shared among friends who stay a while and warm your soul.

Let us remember, as we step into designing realms, we are more than architects of structure and form. We are cultivators of human experience—a shared journey littered with both understated nuances and grand gestures of otherworldly grace.
