# How To Measure ROI Of Video Marketing With Wistia

*The moment the idea struck us was somewhere between the coffee spill on the keyboard and the neighbor's dog barking through the open window—right when we were in the middle of reviewing our annual video marketing budget. Who knew? Video content was eating away our resources faster than a seven-year-old with a bag of Halloween candy. "What's our ROI on this?" someone had asked. A reasonable question. That marked the beginning of our bewildering, joyous journey into measuring video marketing ROI, with Wistia as our trusty guide, navigator, and occasional jester.*

## Discovering What Matters Most

Remember the times when we measured success by how many people laughed at the boss's jokes during meetings? Quantifying video marketing ROI is slightly less predictable but infinitely more rewarding. We clutched our coffee mugs—this time ensuring all lids were attached properly—as we realized, it’s metrics that guide your path. 

We kicked things off by determining key performance indicators, or KPIs if you’re up for an acronym-heavy evening. These metrics, from audience interaction rates to conversion outcomes, pinpoint where your video excels or falls flat. With Wistia, those metrics were easy to dissect—no scalpel required.

**Setting Up Goals in Wistia**
  
- **First Steps & Strategy:** Set measurable goals by identifying the purpose—more than just existing, ask yourself why you bothered creating that ornate video of a cat wearing a bowler hat.
- **Custom Properties:** Use Wistia's Custom Properties feature to begin tagging. Tags are like digital post-it notes—sticky, bright, hard to miss.
- **Turning Data Into Insight:** Now, this isn't just about collecting data and letting it sit on your computer like dust on a forgotten shelf; it’s actionable insights. Use Wistia’s heatmaps and engagement graphs to see where viewers drop off. 

By the time the neighbor's dog was exchanging philosophical musings with the moon, we had tangible goals written down. Our endeavor wasn’t just to be liked but to be effective.

## Tracking the Right Metrics 

The tools of our newfound trade were spread out before us, like woodcarving tools for a sculptor. To measure that elusive ROI, tracking the right metrics became our carving knife.

**Engagement First:**
  
- **Viewer Engagement:** Review how long viewers stay tuned without being distracted by shiny objects. With Wistia’s metrics, this became a see-it-to-believe-it factor.
- **Play Rate:** Imagine, they clicked play! Track how many of those mousings convert to plays.
- **Action Surges:** Measure growth during and after videos. After all, who doesn’t love a good comeback story?

Suddenly, it didn't matter if the dogs barked or chores piled up. Here was clarity at last, wheezing past our fog of doubt like a brisk wind.

## Utilizing Wistia Features Like a Pro

After numerous mugs of unevenly brewed coffee and moments of epiphany that came unprompted—usually in the shower—we became adept at using Wistia’s complex world of video analytics. And no, it doesn’t need to be befuddling.

**Harness the Power of Heatmaps:**

- **Heatmaps as Allies:** These colorful graphs aren’t just for science class. They reveal how your viewers interact, much like heat sensors reveal the best spot by the campfire.
- **Detailed Attention:** Dive deeper. Where do viewers pause the most? Rewind? Fast forward? These are treasure maps leading to viewer insights.

**Collecting Emails Like Seashells:**

- **Turn Views into Leads:** Wistia’s Turnstile feature lets you collect emails right in your videos, creating a bridge between ‘just looking’ and ‘here’s my number.’
- **Tactical Lead Nurturing:** Nurture those leads by crafting follow-up content that evolves the story in their inbox—because everyone loves a good sequel. Think 'Godfather II,' not 'Sharknado 5.'

We learned the ropes, tripping occasionally but gaining poise swiftly. The whole stash of video assets seemed alive with possibility, approachable and strategically valuable.

## Calculating Monetary Impact

Amidst the joyful chaos of judging engagement and lead growth, it’s essential to reflect on monetary ROI—traditionally measurable, much like the growl of an empty wallet. The financial impact reminds us why we embarked on this journey, distinguishing itself like a lighthouse beam to seafarers. 

**Let’s Monetize:**

- **Cost Per Lead (CPL):** Sit down and calculate CPL by dividing your total video marketing spend by new leads generated. It’s arithmetic with more potential than a kid's math homework.
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** It’s a bit fancy but essentially, how much $$$ was spent to gain those delightful folks known as customers?

It would've been easy to get lost in cashed checks and tally marks on spreadsheets if it wasn't for the iron-clad thrill of discovering just how effectively we were operating.

## Concluding the Odyssey

In the end—like heroic squires returning to Camelot—we armed ourselves with rich data that was actionable and satisfying, giving us stories to tell over candlelit dinner parties. Our journey taught us more than just numbers; it rekindled the spirit of creativity and accountability in video marketing.

It also taught us that while coffee spills might turn into unexpected milestone markers, commitment and tools like Wistia could help demystify the marvels of video marketing ROI. The neighbor’s dog, possibly wiser now, continues its moonlit serenades but with less impatience—knowing order has been restored in the universe of video marketing analytics.
