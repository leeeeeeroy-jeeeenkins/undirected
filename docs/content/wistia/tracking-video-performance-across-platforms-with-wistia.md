# Tracking Video Performance Across Platforms With Wistia

Once upon a time—we've always wanted to start a story like that—my buddy Jake and I decided to make a string of wacky pet videos. We weren't looking for Hollywood fame; the goal was just to brighten someone's day with a cat wearing sunglasses or a dog doing yoga. Jake, with his eternal optimism and an uncanny knack for holding his phone at just the right angle, said, "Let's conquer the world of video platforms!" We did it to spread joy, the good kind. Turns out, watching videos is one thing; knowing if they actually reach people, influence them, or vanish into the digital void is another ordeal entirely.

After a couple of months, our phones buzzed at 3 AM, pancakes almost burned (okay, maybe I burned them), and we hadn't the faintest idea if anyone was even watching. That's when we stumbled upon Wistia. It was our knight in shining digital armor—a video platform to track engagement and performance across the vast labyrinth of platforms. Here's how we, a couple of amateur pet video enthusiasts with no capes but abundant curiosity, started our escapade in tracking video performance with Wistia.

## Discovering the Data Goldmine 

We knew stats could be dead boring. Numbers can make you feel as if you're deciphering an ancient tome while sipping ineffective herbal tea. However, Wistia does not make you sift through arcane texts; no sir, it offers a goldmine—treasures polished with intuitive insights, almost like telling you, "Hey, your video is doing just fine." 

So, we set off on this journey, first by diving into Wistia’s analytics dashboard. Yes, the first step is as simple as making the sign-in gesture on that website: Go to [Wistia's website](https://wistia.com), enter your credentials, and get ready to have your mind blown!

### Setting Up Shop

Once we were in, the dashboard greeted us with a strange mix of numbers and charts—like the ones you'd see on those financial TV shows—but instead of boring stocks, it was about our goofy pet videos. Time to get serious:

1. **Upload Your Videos**: We started by clicking on the inviting 'Upload' button, something Jake said seemed more like dancing on a shiny first button. Truly, no special effects or CGI needed here, just drag and drop your clips, right from your desktop. Even a seasoned procrastinator like I couldn't find a reason to delay.

2. **Organize with Projects**: It's akin to organizing books on a shelf, only books are creative videos full of shenanigans. Wistia allows for organizing videos into what they charmingly call 'Projects.' So, our cat-bunny series had a neat little home.

3. **Integrate with Platforms**: This was our way of mingling. We used Wistia’s integrations—publishing directly to platforms like YouTube or embedding on our Wordpress blog was seamless. It’s as if Wistia hands you a magical door opener for each platform.

### Crunching the Numbers Without Self-Destructing

We were curious about how far our pet hilarities had reached. Wistia’s analytics? Delightful, without any of that heart-palpitating math anxiety.

1. **Engagement Graphs**: Our first real encounter with the digital pulse of society. These graphs told us when viewers drooled with interest and when they skedaddled or took snack breaks. Watching graphs move up and down felt like monitoring a digital seesaw.

2. **Heatmaps**: Oh, the magic of color-coded insights! These lovely maps let us see which parts of our video captured viewers’ hearts (or more accurately, their eyes), and which parts made them jump ship. Jake exclaimed, "Our dog's head tilt scene? It’s red-hot!"

3. **Play Rate**: This percentage wasn't about missing classes or skipping work. It showed us the ratio of views versus appearances out there in cyberspace. In simple terms, it’s like seeing how many guests at your party actually tasted the pizza versus those who bailed.

## Fiddling with Customization 

Like artists refining a masterpiece—or, in our case, tinkering with cat eyeglasses—customization piqued our interest. Wistia offers tools that let you mold viewer experience like gooey dough.

### Personalizing Your Player

Our videos needed personalities matching their stars, and Wistia allowed just that. 

1. **Player Customization**: Changing colors, adding a logo, or customizing the controls? It was like dressing your video in an elegant digital tuxedo. We added a slider for ambiance music control—because yes, sometimes background crooning is everything. 

2. **Turnstile Email Collectors**: Imagine a whimsical gatekeeper asking for emails before letting viewers delve into our quirky clips. Surprisingly, it works like a charm for gathering a league of subscribers.

3. **CTAs (Call-to-Actions)**: Wistia allows for nifty CTAs—buttons or messages—popping up to engage your audience. We added, "Wanna see more wiggles? Subscribe!" right when the viewers' smiles were widest.

### Going Beyond with Integrations

Nothing jazzes up video content like smart innovations and integrations. Wistia connected us with tools like HubSpot and Mailchimp—they sent the right chills down the marketers' spine, or as Jake called it, "the productive shiver."

1. **Third-Party Integration**: With marketing integrations, our videos weren't just standalone acts on a deserted island. We blended them into campaigns seamlessly, advertising our laziest cat's yoga attempts.

2. **Linking Back to CRM**: Linking video data back to CRM was like connecting Captain Kirk with the USS Enterprise. Wistia ensures data enriches customer profiles, offering clearer pathways to future engagement.

## Embracing the Laughter and Learning

Through this whimsical adventure and startling discoveries, Wistia—an unintended MVP in our tale—offered an intuitive yet robust playground. We’ve learned our humor sprawled wide and our furry clips tickled more than a few million imaginary ribs.

Now, we're not saying anyone can predict if their video's gonna tickle the right fancy just by staring eagerly at a screen full of Wistia graphs and maps. But suddenly, we became informed, fierce creators armed not only with delightful videos but powerful insights too—and our pancake crisis was history.

So there it is, our yabber about interpreting video performance on each platform wide and far using the simplest of tools. We, a mere bunch of digital merrymakers, found Wistia not just reliable but downright necessary to navigate the unruly seas of video content. And as we leaned backward into those comfy chairs, with a sigh of relief, Jake remarked, "Isn’t data quite the hilarious companion?"

In the truest sense, data became our unwavering little beacon, a faithful sidekick on our video circus journey.

Now, go forth! May your videos too find their home, buffeted by insights as joyful and colorful as your imagination.
