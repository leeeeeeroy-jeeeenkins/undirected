# How To Use Wistia's Turnstile Feature To Capture Leads

### A Surprisingly Enlightening Saturday Afternoon

Let’s rewind to a drizzly Saturday afternoon. You know the kind where it's just perfect to ignore the pile of laundry and delve into something wonderfully nerdy—to discover a marketing tool you never fully embraced. I was sipping a perhaps too-hot cup of coffee (the kind that leaves your tongue with that slightly painful sensation for a whole day!), and I found myself clicking through a myriad of options on Wistia. I remembered an earlier conversation with Jane—my colleague who cleverly uses video like a wizard weaving spells to attract and capture leads—and thought, "Well, if Jane can do it, why the heck can’t I?" 

The catalyst was Turnstile: Wistia’s simple yet potent feature that allows the magician-like capture of leads via video. Intrigued? You should be. Allow me to share my enchanting afternoon discoveries with you and meander through the easy-peasy steps to elevate our video content into lead-capturing gold mines.

### Step 1: Setting the Stage - Register and Upload

The first act opens with a humble browser. Starting your Wistia journey is a matter of logging in or creating an account. We shall gloss over the login details here because that’s just trivial, appetizer stuff. Into the main entrée we dive with a simple click on that "Upload" button, poised and ready to deliver our chosen masterpiece of a video onto the Wistia platform.

Here, imagine yourself as a careful gardener, refining your visual landscape. This is where you select your favorite video—something that speaks volumes in silence perhaps or yells through color and moving images—and hit that delightful “Open.” It’s uploading, and lo and behold, we're already firmly on the path to turning mere visitors into leads.

### Step 2: Unleashing the Turnstile Magic

Let us conjure the magic spell itself by navigating directly to the “Turnstile” feature—a wondrous part of Wistia's player that allows us to collect emails directly from our adoring video audience. It's magic without the wand, and it starts in the video settings where you, the master sorcerer, choose to add a Turnstile.

In the video settings, find "Timeline Actions" and select "Turnstile." This is where we tweak the tiny details that shall make our video a masterpiece—decide exactly when to ask our audience for their email. Beginning, middle, or end, the choice is ours! By default, Turnstile makes its regal appearance right at the commencement, but with a simple drag on the timeline, we can choose when this tiny digital wizard shall pop on-screen.

### A Small Detour: Laugh-worthy Missteps

Allow us a pause for a moment to share a chuckle. Remember our friend Jane? Yes, she once set Turnstile at the video's very end—thinking folks would be enchanted to the very last second—but alas, sometimes the allure of a "skip" button is far too tempting. It’s important to perfectly balance the placement of your Turnstile; think of it as offering a wafer during that coffee—you offer it when things are quite perfect.

### Step 3: Craft the Spell - Customization

Our stage is nearly set, and now for the personal touch—the craftsmanship that will attract and capture. This isn't just about asking for emails; this is a chance to speak directly to your audience. Customize that message: “Join the adventure!”, “Let us connect!” or even a cheekily simple “Got Email?” tease the address right out from them with a smile.

Head to the settings and weave your own flair—type in a message that’s uniquely you. Choose whether you shall allow social logins; after all, who doesn’t fancy a swift login with Facebook or Google these days? Convenience is key.

Remember, in a previous adventure, we wrote: “To get the magic landing in your inbox”—a line as cheesy as it is charming. It worked, and it could work wonders for you. Try out different guises and see what spell conjures the most responses.

### Step 4: Test, Adjust, and Reflect… a Lot 

Now, partners in video lead capturing, here's where we become mad scientists. Test it out: hit "Play" on that video, immerse yourself, and observe how it organically fits into your presentation. Is your Turnstile disruptive, or does it glide into the spotlight like a graceful dancer? Reflect.

Testing is an ongoing mission—an adventure where each hurdle brings new wisdom. Adjust the timing of Turnstile, modify your message, and change the visuals if you must. Discover what resonates.

Our Turnstile adventure that rainy Saturday led to an unfurling of possibilities—a delightful domino of “What ifs” and “Ah, yes!” Until finally, the emails began arriving like a gentle rain washing over parched earth.

### Final Flourish - The Curtain Call

We’ve reached that point, haven’t we? Where it all comes together, and like the perfect symphony transitions to its final note, your Turnstile is now live. Publish your creation with confidence and free yourself to watch, repeat, tweak, refine. Much like any development process, it’s a never-ending story—a poetic loop of creation and iteration.

And so, there you have it. This tale of a rainy Saturday, a cup of tongue-numbing coffee, and Jane’s wizardry in video marketing. Together, we navigated the realms of Wistia’s Turnstile and learned to cast our own enchantments to capture leads. As we close the curtain on this stage, remember, it's the curious discovery and joy in creation that lies at the heart of it all.

Try it out, share your tale, and never stop exploring the marvelous ways we can connect, interact, and capture the magic of our world.
