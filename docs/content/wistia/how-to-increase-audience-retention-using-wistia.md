# How To Increase Audience Retention Using Wistia

## My Journey into Wistia's Wonderland

Let's step back to one brisk Thursday evening when I found myself twiddling my thumbs, pondering the abysmally low audience retention figures for our video series. The realization was as jarring as a toddler discovering the square peg doesn’t fit the round hole. My stomach churned like a stormy sea, yet I was undeniably determined to turn the tide. Armed with a cup of lukewarm coffee and Wistia's blue-tinted beacon of hope on my laptop screen, I embarked into the whimsical world of video analytics and retention tactics. How better to paint my mundane canvas into a vibrant panorama?

What's more, the journey was less like traversing a desert—parched and tedious—and more like spelunking through those mysterious caverns where one’s imagination flares. Let's unfurl our slightly comical, somewhat enlightening guide on how we can uplift audience retention using Wistia.

## Captivating Content Story: The First Impression

It was late, probably absurdly so, when we discovered our audience flew off faster than an overworked barista at the end of her shift. Videos need to grip people from the get-go. Think about that friend who can spin yarns so captivating that dinner stretches into an all-night affair. It's akin to our video content.

### Creating Resonant Thumbnails and Titles

Even a casual thumbs up—or thumbs down, for that matter—begins with an alluring thumbnail. We toyed with our visual allure, trying to replicate the pull of a starry sky on a balmy night.

- **Step 1**: Log into your Wistia account.
- **Step 2**: Navigate to your video library and select a video. 
- **Step 3**: Click on the thumbnail settings and either choose a frame from the video or upload a custom image.
- **Step 4**: Pair it with an inviting title – one that lures in the inquisitive minds and reads like the punchline of a joke you just have to tell.

A great thumbnail and title are like a wink from across the room—irresistibly intriguing.

### Crafting a Captivating Intro

Then there's the first 10 seconds, the Festival of Lights to your video’s Diwali, illuminating paths not taken.

- Be it storytelling, humor, or evoking emotion—those first few beats must crackle with that unmistakable magic.
- Keep your introductions snappy—trim them down until they're nothing more than the soul of wit, as Shakespeare would say.

The initially dreary metrics started showing signs of life, like plants sprouting after the first rain. With these small changes, Wistia whispered promises of long-lasting engagement.

## Engage the Ever-Elusive Viewer with Interactive Features

I remember sitting back one weekend and thinking, "What if our viewers could join the dance rather than just watch?" Wistia had some unexpected tools in its bag of tricks—engagement features that, when used creatively, could turn passive viewers into fiery participants.

### Using Interactive Elements in Videos

The real game-changer came when we sprinkled those videos with interactive elements like a seasoned chef seasoning their masterpiece.

- **Add Chapters**: Segment your video for easier navigation. It’s like using a GPS—spur of the moment detours still get us back on track.
  - **Step 1**: Go to your video's timeline.
  - **Step 2**: Click on the chapter button, add headings, and select timestamps.
- **Implement Turnstile**: Nothing halts an ambler than the promise of tantalizing content if they just share their email. Make it feel worth it—like a plush seat with a mountain view.
  - **How**: Navigate to your video and select the turnstile option from the settings.

Our audience seemed to sit up straighter, more alert, and attentive, much like I did after accidentally sipping mint tea expecting chamomile.

## Analytics: The Retention Detective's Best Friend

A discovery akin to finding my old comic collection came as I burrowed deeper into Wistia's analytics. The Swiss army tool for figuring out what's making viewers jump ship faster than rats on a sinking vessel or rather, what's keeping them anchored like sailors with loyalty tested.

### How to Use Wistia Analytics 

We could see where people dropped off, like unmapped exit signs and pivot accordingly. It was more of science than art—data-driven decisions that resulted in pure magic.

- **Step 1**: Click on the 'Insights' tab.
- **Step 2**: Dive into Heatmaps. Each color splat on this thematic map offers hints of where your video’s hotspots are—perhaps the delightful antics of the squirrel in the background at 2:31 are what's truly riveting.
- **Step 3**: Tweak, test, and transform.
  - See what's working, be courageous in cutting loose anything that isn’t—persistance and midnight oil burning do pay off eventually.

Our own metrics enjoyed a renaissance—viewership graphs bending upwards like sunflowers straining for the sun. How gratifying to see rewards for our late-night toil!

## Precise Calls-to-Action: The Video Conductor

It was much later, in the predawn quiet, that I realized we'd neglected one major character in our video symphony: the Call-to-Action. Wistia offered some generous assistance in this realm, suggesting concise, creative direction for our viewer.

### Designing Effective CTAs

Instead of just whimpering "pretty please" to our viewers, we tried a different tune, emboldening them to join us on a quest or undertake other sundry activities disguised as calls to action.

- **Step 1**: Decide on your CTA’s purpose before wielding it like a claymore. Is it more subscribers? Is it visits to a webpage? Decide, then act.
- **Step 2**: From your video's menu, choose to add a CTA. Design it like you would your signature cocktail or favorite dessert—enticing and hard to refuse.
- **Step 3**: Utilize Wistia’s embeddable badges. They're slick and whisper "click me" quite persuasively.

It helped to think less like demanding bosses and more like those affable guides in adventures. We found something charming about letting the viewer join the fun, waltzing in step with us.

## The Ephemeral Curtain Call

In the end, upping our audience retention didn't just mean a shift in numbers but a profound transformation in how we told stories or shared moments. Wistia was our trusty guide—a wise old sage full of wit and quirks—and our audience, the ever inquisitive explorers who lingered a little while longer, fully engrossed in our narrative tapestry.

Each improvement was a thread we just had to tease apart, like a seam that refused to be undone or an ancient, rusty key to untangle. What a brilliantly surprising journey it’s been—and one I dare say was well worth every headbang and midnight brainstorm!
