# Best Practices for Video SEO in Wistia

Let me take you back to a time when we were wrestling with a beast of a problem that was stubbornly resisting any attempts at submission: video SEO. It was the kind of challenge that keeps you up at night, brainstorming with nothing but a half-empty mug of cold coffee and an overly friendly cat for company. We were in the trenches, elbows-deep in analytics dashboards that seemed as cryptic as hieroglyphics to an uninitiated eye. But Wistia, with its delightfully user-friendly interface, felt like a rare gem. It was a true north star guiding us through a tangled forest of keyframes and search algorithms.

## Discovering the Importance of Video SEO

It hit us like a ton of bricks - in a good way, of course. There we were, casually sipping on our well-earned cappuccinos, when Linda (the perpetually optimistic member of our team) strolled in like she had just unraveled the secrets of the universe. “Why don’t we optimize the video content instead of just the webpage?” she asked, eyes twinkling with the mischievous sparkle of someone who's onto something big. 

So, naturally, we dove headfirst into researching everything Wistia had to offer in terms of video SEO. You would think it’s all about metadata and maybe sprinkling some keywords like fairy dust, but oh no, it’s so much more, dear reader.

### Optimize Your Video Metadata

First things first, you need to make your metadata shine so bright that search engines can't help but notice it. Imagine, for a moment, that you’re writing a dating profile for your video. You want to highlight its most attractive traits. It’s all about making your video match with the algorithm’s preferences.

1. **Title**: Create a captivating title. Make sure it’s descriptive yet catchy. Using relevant keywords is crucial. But remember, no keyword stuffing—we want to keep it classy.
2. **Description**: Paint a vivid picture with your words. Write a couple of juicy paragraphs that tease the main content of your video while slipping in a few keywords naturally. Think of it like whispering to the search engine, "Hey, over here!"
3. **Tags**: Sprinkle those keywords judiciously, like you would season a gourmet pasta dish. They help classify the content so it aligns with what people are searching for.

It was like watching a plant grow—slow and at times frustrating—but satisfying when you finally see the fruits of your labor. (“Could you believe we never used tags properly?" someone would inevitably ask during team meetings.)

### Transcripts and Closed Captions

There was a moment when Sam (our resident improviser) pointed out that not everyone watches videos with sound on. Lightbulb moment. Accessibility extends to everyone, not just those who live and breathe soundscapes. We quickly discovered that both transcripts and closed captions are invaluable. They not only make content accessible but they're also a gold mine for SEO. 

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Create a Transcript**: Use a reliable transcription service or spend a little extra time typing it out manually to ensure accuracy. Upload it directly to Wistia. 
2. **Closed Captions**: Make sure they are synced perfectly with your video. A poorly timed caption is like a missed punchline at a comedy show—awkward and off-putting.

Imagine being one of the early settlers discovering the Grand Canyon, only to find out there’s gold at the bottom. That’s how thrilling it was to realize the impact this had on our SEO game. There’s something inherently satisfying about stumbling upon a nugget of wisdom, and this was one of those glorious aha moments.

### Thumbnail Optimization

Ah, the humble thumbnail. Often overlooked, but when done right, this little image is like the peacock feather of your video, strutting its stuff across the internet. 

1. **Custom Thumbnails**: Choose or create a thumbnail that’s eye-catching and relevant to your content. It’s the first thing viewers will see, long before they hit the play button, so make it count. 
2. **Quality & Size**: Ensure your thumbnail is high-resolution. A pixelated image screams amateur.
3. **Text Inclusion**: Adding a snazzy piece of text can make your thumbnail more informative and enticing.

In our earlier days, we randomly selected thumbnails like flipping a coin, not realizing how significant they were. We laughed about it afterward—oh, the innocence of yesteryears—but we learned and evolved, didn’t we?

### Analytics and Adjustments

Ah, numbers. They don’t lie, but they sure love to taunt us. With video SEO, there’s no set-it-and-forget-it. It's a living, breathing entity requiring nurturing and data-driven decisions. Wistia’s analytics allowed us to crawl inside the psyche of our audience. 

#### Key Metrics to Monitor:

1. **Play Rate**: This tells you if the viewer found your video appealing enough to start watching. If the rate is low, it might be time to revisit your thumbnails or metadata.
2. **Engagement**: This indicates how much of the video was watched and when people tended to drop off. Was it during my boring monologue? Probably. 
3. **Conversions**: How many viewers took action after watching? This could be signing up for a newsletter or, better yet, subscribing to more content.

Adjust based on what the data is showing. We used to think of analytics as an unfriendly nemesis, but it was only trying to teach us.

### Embedding and Sharing

Lastly, the power of embedding and the art of sharing. We underestimated it at our peril. Think of it like a party—would you want to keep it confined to just one room? Of course not! You want it spilling over into the backyard and maybe even the neighbor's garden.

1. **Embed Wisely**: Wistia offers smart embedding options. Place your videos where they matter most—in blogs, landing pages, and even those email newsletters you send only to hear crickets chirp.
2. **Social Media Sharing**: Use social media to bring your videos to the masses. Create teasers or trailers to pique interest and draw them to the full content.

The realization that our work could live beyond the confines of our website was a revelation. It’s like opening all the doors and windows on a crisp spring day.
