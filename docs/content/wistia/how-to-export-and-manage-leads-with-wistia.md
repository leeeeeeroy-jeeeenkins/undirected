# How To Export And Manage Leads With Wistia

Ah, the chronicles of digital marketing adventures—you may have been there too, with a cup of overly-steeped tea on one side and tangled cables on the other. Picture this: it was a Thursday afternoon and the rain was competing against my window, a relentless drummer showing no signs of stopping. I was juggling through the endless tabs open in my browser—Facebook, some random cat video, and of course, Wistia. A casual scroll turned into a haywire pursuit of lead management nirvana. I had just hit a realization. Like, mind-blown! Wistia was the magical unicorn I never knew I needed for lead management.

## The Aha Moment: Wistia Reveals Its Secrets

Let’s set the stage, an actual eureka moment—not like the last one involving a rubber duck and unscrewing the door handle. Wistia touts itself as being incredibly user-friendly. And yes, this isn’t another sales pitch from the mouth of an unwitting, cookie-cutter marketer. The noise-canceling headphones were on, and wow—the birds were singing, not outside but metaphorically. Wistia was more than just videos; it was an undiscovered galaxy of potential leads waiting to be exported.

Here’s our first dive into the pool of lead management. Let's take this journey together:

### Step 1: Setting Up for Lead Collection

Before exporting, you need leads. Duh! It’s like trying to sell an empty box. Focus on building a killer video that could dance its way into your audience's hearts. Familiar faces like Steve from marketing had already started seeing results after placing Call-to-Actions (CTAs) at strategic points in their videos. The more stealthy your CTA, the better you reel them in—like the shark, not the fish.

- Head into Wistia
- Choose the video you wish to use
- Add a Turnstile. What’s that you ask? Only the most underrated tool for nabbing emails at lightning speed.

### Step 2: The Art of Export

Shall we unearth the mystical cavern that is lead exportation? Don’t run! Our feet are steady, and you have snacks at the ready. Spoilers: there’s no wand-waving, just a couple of clicks.

- Navigate to your account dashboard. It's in the upper-right corner—the place where joy resides.
- Tap on ‘Contacts’ to see your leads. Beams of light just hit your precious data.
- Feel any fear of misplaced buttons fade away as you click ‘Export’.

What’s this wizardry? A handsomely arranged CSV file appears. Excel lovers, this is your playground now. 

### Step 3: Managing Exported Leads

Breathe, my friend, our journey isn’t over yet. You have crossed into a realm where your exported leads require gentle care like cacti—minimal watering but significant attention.

There was that one time Emily spilled her coffee on the keyboard trying to manage her exported leads. As a team, we vowed no coffee near computers, like ever. Here’s how you can dodge digital calamities:

- Use your CRM to import these leads. Some hotshots prefer Salesforce, while others sway towards Zoho. What’s your poison?
- Segment your leads based on engagement. This isn’t just data; it’s a virtual pet waiting for you to play matchmaking.
- Strategize follow-ups, send personalized emails. Make your emails dance, not just sit idly.

### Step 4: Analyzing Results

Pat your back if you’ve made it this far. Look at us, sophisticated data analysts, crunching numbers like chips at a family barbecue.

- Revisit Wistia Analytics—surprisingly addictive, we must say—and peek into how your CTAs are performing.
- Check open rates, click-through metrics, and sweat over low performance only for a moment before plotting world domination—figuratively.

Let the rollercoaster of stats and patterns bring a knowing smile to your face.

## The Epilogue: A Digital Dance

As our lead expedition comes full circle, there’s a lightheart in knowing we’re prepared for the wild, wild realms of digital marketing. Remember how significant that rainy Thursday became? What seemed like a daunting task is now a majestic tapestry woven with lead data and marketing success stories.

And for that moment we forgot to mention, when Emily's accidental coffee spill led to a viral 'tutorial gone wrong' post, gaining more traction and inadvertently more leads—sometimes chaos leads to the sweetest victories.

Our dance with Wistia spans across the delicacies of exporting and managing. It’s where technical skill meets human ingenuity, and where every click ripples through the vast digital landscape like a perfect acapella harmony.

Take this guide as your compass through the bustling bazaar of online leads, with Wistia as your trustworthy stallion—or unicorn. 

No forgotten tea or tangled cables. Just a quiet room, a focused mind, and an intricate dance with the digital realm.

Keep clicking forward, my friend.
