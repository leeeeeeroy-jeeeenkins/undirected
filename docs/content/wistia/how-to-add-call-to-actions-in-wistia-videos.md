# How To Add Call To Actions In Wistia Videos

Curled up on our sofas one rainy afternoon, sipping on what was probably our fifth cup of coffee — because, why not? — we found ourselves knee-deep in the digital jungle that is video marketing. I remember vividly how my friend Alex and I were staring at an innocuous Wistia video, envisioning the countless ideas spinning in our heads. We wondered aloud, "What if this perfectly edited masterpiece didn’t just entertain but also nudged viewers to take action?" That’s when the proverbial light bulb went off, and our journey into the world of Call to Actions (CTAs) in Wistia videos began.

Buckle up, dear readers, as we embark on this expressive yarn of clicks, embeds, and conversions, full of life, color, and practical know-how.

## Understanding the Magic of CTAs

First, let’s consider what a CTA – the abbreviated Sir Charm-a-Lot of the marketing realm – really is. It's that charming wink or not-so-subtle nudge that prods us to "Buy Now," "Learn More," or "Subscribe." In terms of videos, a CTA transforms passive viewing into an engaging dialogue. We wanted our audience to do more than just watch; we wanted them to participate, to join us in our digital escapade.

Wistia, the behind-the-scenes wizardry provider, offers a plethora of tools to seamlessly integrate these CTAs into your videos. And guess what? It's not as complex as assembling flat-pack furniture at 2 AM. Been there, by the way, and it was chaos. But worry not; follow along with us for a step-by-step tango into the world of actionable video content.

## Diving into Wistia: Setting the Stage

Imagine Wistia as a vast, orderly library and your video as the next bestseller waiting to be uncovered. Now, let’s assume you've uploaded your video on Wistia – if not, go ahead and do so; it's the first logical step, after all. Once that's settled, we proceed with the CTAs.

From the dashboard, you'll notice a tranquility-inducing button labeled "Customize." Click it like you’re clicking 'Add to Cart' for your favorite gadget.

## Step-by-Step: Crafting Your First CTA

Ah, the Customize screen – feels like stepping into an art gallery where your video is the centerpiece. Here's how you decorate it with a CTA:

### 1. **Navigating to the Timeline Action**

Hover over to the left and click "Timeline Actions." Don’t worry, it’s not as ominous as it sounds. It’s like choosing toppings for your pizza — except it’s video toppings.

### 2. **Adding the CTA Magic**

Once you find the right spot on the timeline – that ideal moment when your viewer’s interest is piqued – click the plus "+" button. Select "Call to Action" from the menu. This is where the adventure truly begins.

### 3. **Designing the CTA**

Time to play the muse. Design your CTA by adding a compelling title, choose wisely – like a perfect Halloween costume. Then, think about the actual action. Do you want them to visit a page, subscribe? The options are yours to ponder. 

```markdown
**Title:** "Join Our Creative Journey"  
**Button Text:** "Join Us"  
**Button URL:** `https://yourwebsite.com/join`
```

### 4. **Position, Position, Position**

Position the CTA on the video screen. Top-left, center, bottom-right — get creative, but ensure it's visible. Alex always says, "A lost CTA, like a lost sock, benefits no one."

### 5. **Save & Test**

Once positioned, save your masterpiece like you’d lock in your Wordle guess. Now test it. Yes, click like you’re not quite sure about your own Wi-Fi connection. 

## The Experience of Optimization: Tweaking and Testing

Some may find this tedious, but we found it enlightening – like adjusting the seasoning in Grandma's famous tomato sauce. Once you get your CTA out there, play with timing and location based on feedback, adjust as needed. Remember when Alex thought it’d be funny to place a CTA right as I’m sneezing mid-video? Yeah, don’t be Alex in that instance.

## Integrating with Analytics

Wistia isn't just a video tool; it's a data-crunching marvel. Take full advantage of this. Monitor your CTA's performance through analytics. Question yourself: Are viewers clicking the CTA? Is it too far into the video? Optimize based on these insights.

## Honing the Craft: Best Practices and Our Final Thoughts

After countless process cycles and testing regimes, we've learned a bit. We've stumbled upon a few gold nuggets, too:

- **Keep It Simple**: No one likes a complicated CTA. Make it as straightforward as sharing memes in group chats.

- **Watch the Timing**: Place your CTA at a pivotal moment, when excitement is at its peak.

- **Blend It Well**: It should be part of the video, not an intrusive ad. Make it feel like it belongs, like that rogue jigsaw piece you've finally clicked into place.

In the end, our journey taught us that the beauty of video lies not just in its pixels or the frames per second, but how it speaks to an audience, engages them, and invites them into our world of endless possibilities. Curling back on that couch with Alex, a laptop balanced precariously on one of our knees, we were no longer just enthusiasts; we were storytellers, weaving CTAs into our videos and inviting viewers to take the next step with us.

So, happy Wistia-ing everyone. Onward we create, invite, and engage.
