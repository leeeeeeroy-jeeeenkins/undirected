# How To Use Wistia’s Captions And Transcripts For Accessibility

You know that moment when you think you’ve got life all figured out? I had one of those in a small café, engulfed in the rich aroma of coffee beans and pastries. The sun was serving its golden rays through a window, casting dramatic shadows over my laptop screen. We were there—my friend Jenna and I—to figure out how to make her latest marketing video a beacon of accessibility and inclusion. "How hard can captions be?" I remember Jenna musing between sips of black coffee, a hint of sarcasm in her voice. 

## Captions and Their Secret Power

Imagine a bustling street in New York, a cacophony of sounds bombarding your senses, and yet you're the only one who can’t hear it. That’s the world for those who rely on captions to understand the dialogue. I realized this when Jenna paused the video. "Captioning," she said intently, "is not just text on screen. It’s a bridge." With a nod, I agreed. Wistia’s toolset for captions would soon become our secret weapon.

### Step 1: Setting The Stage

Back in the café, we dived into Jenna's laptop, logging into her Wistia account with slightly more enthusiasm than was probably necessary. Here's what we did:

1. **Upload Your Video**: We clicked on the "Upload" button. I watched, sipping my coffee, as the progress bar inched forward. Patience is key.
2. **Selecting Your Video**: Once the video was uploaded, it was time to select it from the library. Like picking out your favorite vinyl record, it felt significant and slightly thrilling.
3. **Accessing Captions Settings**: In the video settings, we tapped the "Captions" tab. We were about to lift the veil on a feature not often celebrated.
  
### Step 2: Adding Captions

Once within the captions settings, Jenna’s fingers danced over the keyboard. She added captions manually, syncing words with visuals, making sure that everyone—even someone just passing by a laptop—could understand the masterpiece we were creating.

- **Manual Entry**: Click on "Add Captions," then "Upload." Wistia offers both automatic transcriptions and manual uploads. We opted for the latter. There’s something enchanting about crafting each line meticulously, even with some typos, which we immediately fixed.
- **Editing**: With captions added, they appeared like lines of a solid script. We reviewed and adjusted their timing with precision—each line a note in our symphony of accessibility. 

### Step 3: Testing The Waters

Jenna leaned back, hit play, and we watched. If captions were a saucepan, we were the chefs, marveling at our delightful concoction coming to life. But let’s not forget the testing phase! 

- **Watch and Review**: Our eyes glued to the screen, murals of text gliding by the video. We checked for alignment, readability, and accuracy—a sacred captioning ritual.
- **Adjust the Timing**: The phrases needed to match the audio seamlessly. A little earlier or later, and the impact is lost! My phone buzzed with ‘ding!’ confirmations from Jenna as captions snapped into place.

## Transcripts: The Unsung Heroes 

Think about transcripts as the silent companions to our narrative. They assist those who can read but not hear. We tackled this right after the catch-up break—a necessary pause where the power of captions was in full display.

### Step 4: Generating Transcripts

Wistia then became our co-pilot on this journey, offering an automatic transcription service, handy as a pocket on a shirt. With a click, Jenna initiated the process and we waited, our anticipation tempered by caffeine.

- **Auto-Generate**: Inside the "Captions" tab, there’s a neat option to auto-generate transcripts. We wondered if AI felt like a garden gnome cranking out text.
- **Review and Edit**: We fine-tuned the generated text, imbibing life into dry words. Our laughter filled needed breaks from editing odd sounds like ‘umm’ which were reluctantly turned into ellipses by Jenna’s vigorous backspacing.

### Step 5: Download and Share

Why keep the completed transcript a secret? It’s a gift to be shared. We saved the text file—a virtual handshake to those who needed it. 

- **Download**: With a quick click, the transcript downloaded to Jenna’s desktop. Simple as pie or clicking the save icon which definitely isn’t a floppy disk anymore.
- **Distribute**: Jenna sent it off to the team, and I watched another goal ticked off her checklist. 

## Spreading the Word

Using Wistia's features, we didn’t just add words on screen; we created connections. Captioning became an act of storytelling, a manuscript in motion—an inclusion everyone deserves.

We sat back, feeling like patrons of an art show, savoring the small victory in making our little corner of the internet accessible. Just imagine the world if everyone could comprehend every message. Over one last coffee refill, we shared a look of satisfaction. And maybe, just a tiny bit of caffeine-induced exhilaration.

This story we created with Wistia wasn’t just ours, and that’s where the beauty lies. We sat back, relishing the moment, knowing that what we did was more than a task—it was a step towards inclusivity and empowerment. Here's to hoping Jenna’s video reaches ears it never could before—with Wistia, captions, and transcripts, that’s no fantasy. 

The ticking clock reminded us of the world awaiting us outside the café. Yet, our hearts carried the warmth of a job done with love and purpose. Have you ever considered how accessible your creations are? Let’s make them shine for everyone.
