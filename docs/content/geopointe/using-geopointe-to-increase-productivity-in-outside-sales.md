# Using Geopointe to Increase Productivity in Outside Sales

Ah, the wild, sun-soaked arena of outside sales — where the world is your office, and the path to success is carved by skill, perseverance, and occasionally, sheer luck. There was a time not so long ago when our team found itself lost amidst the endless labyrinth of client visits and unscheduled detours. With the sun setting on yet another lukewarm sales quarter, and the team morale hovering just above dismal, our savior came not in a divine bolt of lightning but in the form of Geopointe. It changed everything.

For those unfamiliar, Geopointe is this incredible location-based service that integrates right into Salesforce — think of it as giving your sales force the power of GPS, maps, and territory management, all tied neatly with a bow of efficiency. But more about the tech part later. First, let’s dive back into our story.

## Mapping Our Way Forward

Picture this: It’s a Tuesday, I’m running late as usual, coffee in one hand and a crumpled map in the other — definitely not the kind we asked for. Dan, our ever-resilient sales lead who once got lost on a straight highway, decided that enough was enough. “There’s got to be a better way,” he said, with a fire in his eyes — or perhaps it was residual irritation from the GPS that proudly rerouted him to a cornfield the day before.

Enter Geopointe. Through the symbiotic marriage of Salesforce data and geographical insights, we found our scattered team converged into a coordinated dance of precision and efficiency. No more wandering off into oblivion. With Geopointe, we had our clients, routes, and appointments neatly plotted, eliminating guesswork and missed opportunities.

### Getting Started: Set Up Your Geopointe Integration

From the first sip of the well-brewed magic potion (read: setting up Geopointe), we knew we were onto something big. Here's the low-down on how we rolled it out:

1. **Start by Logging into Salesforce**: Navigate to the AppExchange, that mecca of digital solutions, searching for "Geopointe." Click “Get It Now” and follow the prompt steps like you’re threading through a maze with a map, only now, it's online.

2. **Installation and Permissions**: Ensure users who’ll need access have the correct permissions. We huddled around the screen like a bunch of penguins on an Antarctic night, assigning roles more eagerly than performing user acceptance tests.

3. **Configure Data**: Once installed, it was time to choose which Salesforce objects to map: Leads, Accounts, Contacts — everything it touched turned to gold, or at least became way more organized.

4. **Setting Up Geopointe Maps and Layers**: We added colorful layers that could make any topographic enthusiast drool just a bit, configuring territories and setting rules for optimal routing. It was glorious.

### Streamlining Our Day-to-Day with Geopointe

With Geopointe, the mundane became magnificent. Even our most unenthusiastic reps found a glimmer of joy in their daily runs, powered by the thrill of ticking off visits from a map. Take Stacey, for instance. With the new system, she was no longer a relentless navigator — she was the geolocation queen. 

#### Route Optimization and Real-Time Feedback

Geopointe’s data-driven approach charted the course for the swashbuckling sales savants. Routes were optimized in seconds, displaying real-time traffic updates. Can you imagine the euphoria as Stacey breezed through peak hours like Moses parting the Red Sea of rush hour traffic?

But let’s be honest, this wasn’t just about saving time. It was about breathing life into those minutes saved. Each second was a chance for a meaningful conversation, a deeper relationship, a better pitch. Daniel, for example, no longer arrived frazzled and empty-headed; he was calm, prepared, and, dare I say, charming.

### Visualizing Data and Unearthing Hidden Opportunities

Geopointe charmed us further with its visual prowess. Maps turned into an art form where every pin was a precise opportunity. Picture Jim, our territory manager, staring at a map like Monet contemplating his next masterpiece. He could spot trends and untouched territories at a glance. 

#### Customizing Data Layers

With the ability to add layers, Jim could filter by industry, revenue, and last contact date — all in one glance. It was like an Easter egg hunt for adults, but instead of chocolates, the treasure was potential leads. And let’s admit, Jim had a better nose for leads than for anything else. 

### Increasing Engagement with Clients

It's a crazy kind of magic when you see a tool not only make teams efficient but also transform how they engage. We found ourselves not just doing business — we were building relationships. Vince, with his storyteller charm, could effortlessly revisit locations with enhanced customer histories visible on his handheld map, making every meeting personal and vibrant.

#### Automating Tasks for Human Connection

Geopointe automated the mundane, freeing us to celebrate the personal. Schedule visits, log calls, alter routes — all with a few flicks of our wrist on a touchscreen. It allowed us to focus on the human. We weren’t just selling a product, we were selling trust, and man, did it feel good.

### Reflecting on Success and Paving the Future

Reflecting on our journey — which had begun with a bit of desperation and a whole lot of stubbornness — it became clear that Geopointe was not just a tool or another application; it had become an extension of who we were as a team. In a way, it reflected our resilience and our tenacity to adapt and grow. Each pin on that digital map was a reminder that the unknown could become an opportunity.

### Final Thoughts

Geopointe was our guide in this brave new world of outside sales — a world where we found ourselves more productive and more connected to our clients and each other. It taught us to cherish those moments — the quiet drives, the victories, the humorous mishaps (yes, even you, Dan, and the cornfield incident).

Every end is the start of a new beginning. With Geopointe, the horizon is promising, often surprising, with endless possibilities. The conference room now buzzes with stories of successes and lessons learned, of humorous failures and adventurous detours. We were not just a team — we were charting new paths, with Geopointe as our steadfast compass.

And now, dear friends, as our tale of Geopointe unfurls into the sunset, I see there’s a whole world to get out there and, who knows? Maybe get lost, but in the most productive and wonderful way possible.
