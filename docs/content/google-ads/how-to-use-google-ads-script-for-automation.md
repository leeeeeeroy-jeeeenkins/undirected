# How to Use Google Ads Script for Automation

You know those moments when you're standing in front of the fridge, just staring at it, hoping it will give you all the answers in life? Like, the meaning of existence or why on Earth you keep buying almond milk when you don't even like it. That's exactly how I felt the first time I tried to automate Google Ads. Confused, overwhelmed, and very close to just drinking regular milk again. But then, a light bulb flickered in my brain—let's call it the 'Jason epiphany moment'—named after that quirky friend who always seems to know everything about tech. Jason said, "Why not use Google Ads Scripts?" Thus began our journey into the chaotic yet delightful world of automation.

### The Revelatory First Step: Inspect

Imagine you're Sherlock Holmes, but instead of solving mysteries, you're turning Google Ads into a well-oiled machine. First things first: we must inspect our Google Ads account. Dedicate at least 20 minutes to simply stare at the dashboard. Why? Because that's what Jason would do. Take a look at what needs automating. Bid adjustments? Ad scheduling? Turning mouse clicks into actual gold coins? Identify the repetitive tasks that haunt your dreams and make a checklist.

### The Script Cafe: Writing Our First Lines

The smell of freshly brewed coffee envelops us. That's where we are. Not literally, but in spirit. Armed with a determination as fierce as a cat eyeing a laser pointer, let's open a new Google Ads script. Head over to `Tools & Settings > Bulk Actions > Scripts`, and click the giant purple plus button as if ordering an extra-hot cappuccino at midnight.

Here's a basic script to get us started:

```javascript
function main() {
  var campaignIterator = AdsApp.campaigns()
      .withCondition('Status = ENABLED')
      .get();
  
  while (campaignIterator.hasNext()) {
    var campaign = campaignIterator.next();
    campaign.pause();
    Logger.log('Paused campaign with name: ' + campaign.getName());
  }
}
```

Now, save it. Run it. Watch in awe as your campaigns are paused like obedient soldiers responding to a whistle.

### Testing and Tweaking: Our Personal Lab

Jason once said something about rigging a remote-control car to deliver tacos, which was genius but absolutely risky. Similarly, not every script runs perfectly from the start. Test in a controlled environment—our little Google Ads lab. You know, where if things explode, it’s only metaphorical. Start simple. Look at how changes impact performance. Smile like a genius when they do a little dance on the results graph.

### Friend of Superheroes: Scheduling

Jason always insisted that the most powerful tools are the ones that let you sleep in on a Monday. Schedule your scripts. Yes, automation means never having to say, "I'll do it tomorrow," because hey, it’s already done. In the script interface, click on the 'Actions' dropdown and select 'Schedule.’ Choose your preferred running times, like those first few sips of coffee in the quiet of a morning.

### Closing Thoughts: Embracing Our Inner Script Kiddie

It's funny how automation can make us feel like we're programming protagonists in a world-saving game. Sure, Google Ads Scripts might not save the world, but they’ll save us time, money, and perhaps a little bit of sanity. And isn't that what Jason wanted all along? So let's write, test, tweak, and mostly keep buying almond milk for reasons that make sense only to us.
