# How to Leverage Google Ads Call Tracking

If you're anything like us, you'll remember that slightly chaotic Tuesday last spring when we decided to tackle our client’s spiraling expenses on Google Ads. It was a regular day until it wasn’t. Jerry, our ever-enthusiastic marketing director, waltzed in with that glint of mischief in his eyes. "We're leaking calls, folks," he declared. Ah, yes – calls, those elusive creatures we thought we had in the bag. That day, we discovered something extraordinary: Google Ads Call Tracking. Yes, tracking calls, like tracking elusive unicorns in a forest, or so it seemed at first.

Now, before we dive into the nitty and the gritty of the process, imagine this: people discovering your business, but as they dial in, their traces vanish into the digital ether. How do we ensure these calls aren’t just wandering lost souls? Jerry's revelation was simple yet profound, like most eureka moments. Leveraging Google Ads Call Tracking was the torch in this curious labyrinth.

## The Path to Unleashing the Magic of Call Tracking

First off, let's set up our call tracking the old-school way — or as Jerry calls it, the 'Hardcore Manual Method,' with as much bravado as a folk hero. Begin by logging into your Google Ads account, obviously. Navigate like a leaf in the wind over to the "Settings" gear icon and click on "Conversions." If it sounds like finding Narnia, fear not; just follow along.

What happened next felt like alchemy. Create a New Conversion Action by clicking that bright blue plus sign. Think of it as unlocking the secret door. Choose "Phone Calls" from the conversion options. It’s like picking your favorite ice cream flavor — but important. Now, track those calls from ads or website calls like an investigator hot on a trail. Deciphering this tech language doesn’t require a Rosetta Stone — fortunately.

### We Fumbled, We Learned

Our clicking adventures led us to set up the phone conversion values: set a name (a whimsical element—"Call Odyssey," perhaps), value it, count it. Annual “value per call” dinner-table debates with Jerry ensued, predicting revenues like seasoned economists. If you’ve ever placed bets over call durations, well, join the club.

Next, the magic box awaits — the tracking time window. We asked ourselves: “How long does it take for these calls to convert into something tangible, like a pizza delivery?” Define the call length with this pondering — does 60 seconds work, or 90? Ah, the contemplation! Dialogues abound like an existential breakfast club discussion.

## The Joy of Automation

Post-setup, like clockwork, the report displays started filling with numbers so insightful they sang our call tracking saga. With Google's automated reports, we witnessed patterns previously concealed. Numbers whispered secrets, insights danced like lights at a summer festival. The calls once thought to be shadows were quantified, categorized — and cherished.

## A New Perspective on Success

If we learned anything from our unplanned Tuesday brainstorm and Jerry's curious call tracking epiphany, it’s that while numbers might look mechanical, they hold potential stories — adventure narratives hiding in plain view. With Google Ads Call Tracking, it's like meeting an old friend who reminds you of shared stories. 

Let’s keep the spirit of curiosity thriving; never underestimate a good old Tuesday afternoon insight. Together, we've transitioned from call chaos to call clarity. In the world of marketing, our calls are no longer phantom echoes but treasured calls of opportunity waiting to be answered.

Let’s call it a win!
