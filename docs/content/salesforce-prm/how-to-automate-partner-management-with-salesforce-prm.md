# How to Automate Partner Management with Salesforce PRM

Some years ago, there was this moment. It was one of those vivid instances like finding an extra fry at the bottom of the bag, when I realized that managing partnerships was pretty close to juggling knives on a unicycle. In a hurricane. With your mother-in-law watching. Yeah, not exactly stress-free. So there I was, eyes as wide as saucers, drowning in spreadsheets and email threads. That's when Salesforce PRM – our knight in pixelated armor – galloped into my chaotic life, flipping the script on partner management. Little did I know, it would lead us on a journey of automation that felt more satisfying than unraveling the tangled mess of holiday lights without losing our sanity. 

## Unpacking the Chaos 

Before Salesforce PRM, partner management used to be a wild West-style conundrum in our office. We had stacks of sticky notes and calendars that didn't quite sync, kind of like attempting to dance the tango with two left feet. One day, Jane, my fellow compatriot in this partnership escapade, accidently sent a congratulatory email to the wrong partner – cringeworthy, yes. After spending days recovering from that fiasco, we decided we needed a savior, and Salesforce PRM emerged from the chaos.

To kick off your Salesforce PRM journey, the first task is activation – imagine revving up a vintage car that's been sleeping in a barn for decades. It's a fiddly process, but the payoff is immense. Make sure your Salesforce account includes Partner Relationship Management features. If not, no worries, you can contact Salesforce to add it – painless as pie. Begin by enabling Partner Accounts under your Organization’s settings, a crucial yet simple switch that opens up the universe of possibilities. Turns out, every major epic story needs a humble beginning.

## Choreographing the Dance

We weren't alone in this colorful mess. Our partners, having accepted our quirks, were eager to witness this transformation. Like organizing a flash mob, one single misstep might cause a domino effect, leading to spectacular failure – the stakes were high. But Salesforce PRM had an answer in the form of the 'Channel Program Levels.' This feature, akin to choreographing a synchronized swimming performance, helped us categorize partners based on criteria such as performance, regions, or product lines. Boy, did they love it.

After you configure these channel program levels, it's time to create some stunning partner account records. This process is reminiscent of building sandcastles with already pre-approved buckets – format is set, you just have to create them. Through 'Customize - Partners - Account Record Types' menu, define these formats which will act like guide rails in a theme park, ensuring no one ventures off into the unchartered wilderness. Jane would have been thankful for these guide rails back when she accidentally deleted an entire column of vital partner data during a coffee-fueled data entry marathon. 

## Setting the Stage

Now, there’s another layer - consistency, in communicating expectations and results, is king. Jane and I sat, coffee mugs in hand, staring at the abysmal email trails that had inevitably swallowed our teamwork into a blackhole of chaos. Enter: Partner Central Community - Salesforce's answer to this clutter. Using Partner Central, we turned the tables on partner management, offering an online experience that partners could access with ease and less fuss than locating a clean pair of socks on laundry day.

Craft your very own Partner Community by heading over to 'Community Builder'. This online portal allows you to share resources and communicate in real-time, as exciting as discovering a crisp grape in a fruit salad. Utilize templates provided by Salesforce because you can customize them almost as joyfully as decorating cookies at Christmas. Plop in some fancy dashboards - nothing like a bit of eye candy to make those KPIs pop! - and seamlessly offer support via Knowledge and Cases. It's like suddenly having the best customer service hotline ever, minus the infuriating hold music.

## Right Tools for the Right Folks

Adding high-tech tools for our partners was like giving Iron Man his suit but without the downside of rogue AI. Workspaces, Business Plans, and Deal Registration surfaced as the holy trinity of goodies, aligning perfectly with partner needs. Workspaces were neat compartments designed to ensure partners felt like they had personalized space in our digital world's Hogwarts-like corridors.

To assign these tools, head to 'Setup - Feature Settings - Partners'. There, like ticking items off a wandering grocery list, you'll enable tools by partner levels. Creating criteria for deal registration can feel as satisfying as trimming the holiday tree just right. With business plans recounting past triumphs and workspaces fostering future collaborations, it’s like giving partners the ultimate toolkit – no instruction manual needed.

## Celebrating The Wins 

Bumps, bruises, and occasional resounding success stories formed our learning tapestry with Salesforce PRM. By constantly tweaking and adapting, especially after feedback sessions with the partners, it became evident that this was just the beginning of our journey. We had automated processes, won back countless hours, and established more coherent partnerships than an unexpected BFF bonding moment over shared snacks.

But, remember friends, partner management is like cultivating a flourishing garden – it demands continuous care and attention. Nurture it, see what works, tweak what doesn't, and never stop tending to it. When fellow adventurers, like you, take the plunge into this Salesforce PRM realm, may we all continue to share moments worth telling – with sticky hands and huge smiles.

In this version of Salesforce PRM, our endeavor felt nothing short of an odyssey - like finally finding that elusive pot of gold at the end of partner management's rainbow. By reducing our pains, unleashing creativity, and creating a haven for partners, we found that automation isn’t just a technical marvel. It's the beautiful art of transforming chaos into harmony.
