# Using Video and Images in Typeform to Capture Attention

---

You know, sometimes, you just stumble upon an idea that makes you feel like a genius, even if only for a fleeting moment. Picture it: a rainy Tuesday afternoon, when I haphazardly decided to spruce up a Typeform survey. Weird, right? Surveys aren’t exactly the spice of life. But this—this was different. Typeform, with its sleek design, felt more like a dance than a chore. It was here, amidst the looming shadows of numbingly bland text inputs, that the lightbulb flickered—images, videos! Sparks flew. Why hadn't I thought of this sooner? This article, this shared adventure, is about that electrifying discovery and how it can captivate our audiences with images and videos in Typeform.

## The Power of Visuals in a Typographic World

Have you ever noticed how a pop of color or a sudden shift in scenery can pull you back into a moment with a goofy grin, as if you're rediscovering the world for the first time? With Typeform, it’s about making these moments intentional. Visuals can guide, surprise, and engage. We're not just presenting questions; we're inviting conversation, weaving a narrative tapestry that our respondents can't resist touching. Imagine adding a picture of a bustling market to a question about grocery shopping habits—those images add context and immediacy, even on a subconscious level. It’s like asking, isn’t this vibrant hustle exactly what we're talking about?

### Setting the Stage: The Typeform Interface

Let's roll up our sleeves. Picture us both in a tiny digital toolbox, ready to sprinkle some magic. We start with the basics. Once we've wrangled Typeform into submission—essentially just signing in and choosing our format, neither of which require breaking out the thesaurus—we locate the question blocks. Here's where we turn plain vanilla into a sundae with cherry on top. Images and videos nestle warmly alongside questions, waiting to be unleashed. Click that tiny picture icon. A whole world of design dreams opens up.

### From Words to Images: Adding Pictures

Back to our story. I remember stumbling across an old family photo album—that kind of nostalgic cocktail of chaos and warmth where a great-grandparent might suddenly appear on the ceiling. The beauty in those cracked and faded images is precisely how we capture attention with Typeform. Let’s add a photo to a question block.

You click the image icon, and voila, the universe of JPEGs, PNGs, and GIFs stretches before us. Upload directly from your computer, or—even easier—drag and drop! Insert any image that resonates with the question, maybe a timeless meme or a personal photo that speaks your narrative. Instantly, the survey feels alive, as if saying, "Hey, I'm not just text on a screen!"

Here's a quick tip: ensure that your images are optimized for web use because waiting for a picture to load is as fun as watching grass grow. Think small—small enough for yellows, reds, and blues to harmonize without crashing the proverbial concert.

### Motion and Emotion: Video in Typeforms

Okay, so adding images was like waking up with coffee—familiar but exciting. Video, on the other hand, is like learning to fly. It’s bolder, louder. Like that time when we convinced our aunt to star in a family reunion video—hilarious, impromptu, and uniquely memorable. Videos in Typeform can evoke emotions that static images just can’t. 

Embedding a video means clicking the 'video' icon, channeling our inner Spielberg, and selecting our cinematic masterpiece. Upload your own or opt for a YouTube or Vimeo link, and—presto!—it's there, nestled neatly within your survey, an inviting window into laughter, poignancy, or whatever story you’re spinning.

### Crafting Experiences, One Frame at a Time

Images and videos aren’t vividly ornamental; they guide and clarify, like those perfectly placed signs leading us through a confusing labyrinth. They’re the highway markers telling our audience exactly what we are eager to hear.

Remember our Tuesday afternoon discovery? While trying to explain a quirky concept in the survey, I added a video that said it all without saying a word. Suddenly, the respondents caught on, the innate goal unveiled. We were all in on the joke, understanding each other amidst bits and pixels—this is the power of visuals.

### Time to Experiment 

Now that we’ve waxed poetic, it’s your turn to grab the reins. Picture us like mad scientists, stirring elements into bubbling beakers. Typeform is our lab, and visuals our chemicals. Try blending different image styles. Test videos of varying lengths—will a 10-second clip capture more than a longer one? Surprise your audience, delight them, stir curiosity like a spoon through soup.

So, you're standing at that precipice, looking out at a vast ocean of creative possibilities. Next time you're knee-deep in survey monotony, remember: it doesn’t demand magical powers or an encyclopedia of code to build something breathtaking—just a click here, a tweak there.

Let's seize that thrill of experimentation—that irresistible urge to make something brighter, more connected, wonderfully ours. Together, we'll transform chaos into captivating content, one image, and video at a time.

And with that, our journey into the heart of Typeform with images and video concludes. Admittedly, that rainy Tuesday turned out to be not so ordinary—a dance of pixels and narratives interwoven into the mundane that became extraordinary. Just like us really, just like us.
