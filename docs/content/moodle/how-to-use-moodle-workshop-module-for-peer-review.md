# How to Use Moodle Workshop Module for Peer Review

## A Digital Workshop Surprise

You know that moment when you're thrown into an unfamiliar world, and everything feels like an abstract painting come to life? That's precisely how I felt years ago when I was first tasked with creating a peer review assignment in Moodle's Workshop module. It was a day like any other, except my coffee was slightly colder and my to-do list had gained a new, intimidating entry: "Set up peer review." I'd heard tales of the Workshop module—some of whispering bewilderment, others carried in tones of optimism. Our department head, Greta, believed in the magic of the Workshop module even though she'd never used it herself. We were going in blind, armed only with adventurous spirit and the kind of naive hope that good things happen when you least expect them. Would Moodle Workshop be our hero or just another bureaucratic quagmire?

### Getting Started: Signing into Moodle

First thing's first: log into Moodle. Our magical adventure begins in the login screen, much like entering a whimsical library where each book is a portal to another world. Remember your login details (or scribble them somewhere safe). Navigate to your course page, the home base of our digital shenanigans. If we could live inside our courses like in some virtual reality game, we’d be absolute champs by now.

### Setting Up the Workshop

The workshop module is like a mystical tool with countless potential outcomes. To locate it, turn your gaze towards the top right corner where the 'Turn Editing On' button resides. Click it—this is your entry into a realm of infinite possibilities. Once editing is active, select 'Add an activity or resource.' A new window pops up, a buffet of options. Click on 'Workshop.' And with that, Workshop is added to our course—easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

Surprising fact: Greta once accidentally added a Quiz when she meant to add a Workshop. It resulted in bemused students and a lesson learned for all. 

### Configuring the Workshop

Now, onto configuration—a place where legends are created. Provide an apt name and description for your workshop, breathing life into your digital creation. Imagine you're naming a new star in a galaxy and describing its role in the cosmos. Keep it concise yet inspiring. 

Here's where we set the stage: setting up submission and assessment phases. Specify allocation settings, choose submission types, and brace yourself. We also determine how to unleash our students into the wild dash of peer review. Though it might seem like herding cats, remember the number of submissions allowed, which rubrics to use, and crucially, how generous the grading is. Keep options at the ready (Greta often said, “Options are our safety harness” and we believed her).

### Walking Through Submission Phase

When it's time for student submissions, you announce it like opening night at a theater. Students prepare their creative pieces, whether essays, reports, or multimedia submissions. During this phase, students upload their work like artists unveiling their latest opus. Encourage an air of excitement and anticipation. We all know that peer review can be as daunting as limbo on roller skates, but who knows, there might be a future Hemingway among us!

In the Moodle workshop (not to be confused with a sweaty gym), your job is to facilitate, to make sure the runway is clear for takeoff. To keep students informed, use Moodle’s notification system, letting them know their submissions are due with a sense of urgency and cheer. After all, schedules wait for no one.

### Assessment Phase: Let the Reviewing Begin

Here comes the thrilling part. With a steady click, we're diving into the assessment phase. Remarkably, Moodle enables anonymous reviews. Set it up by choosing appropriate allocation methods—random, manual, or scheduled. Add a layer of fairness and mystery to the experience. I felt like a digital Gandalf around this time, weaving peer review magic with a grand purpose.

At this stage, it's crucial to provide clear guidelines, like a lighthouse through the peer review fog. Look, I get it—asking students to review each other’s work can be as nerve-wracking as sharing your last donut. But it strengthens their learning, encouraging reflection and critical skills that eventually trump blatant guesswork.

### Fair and Kind Grading

Ensuring fairness in this academic sea is vital. Implement criteria or grading scales to guide your cadre of budding critics. It’s all about balance, like seasoning a fine risotto or conducting a symphony of trombones. In addition, encouraging constructive feedback ensures it’s not all frothy praise or, heaven forbid, harsh criticism.

It's worth noting that forums or discussions around why feedback matters deeply enrich the peer review process. Ah, the gentle ones who take one for the team by starting these conversations, bless their brave hearts.

### Workshop Close and Grade Release

Closing the workshop needs no grand opera, but a bit of theater doesn’t hurt. Officially announce the curtain call on submissions and assessments. Verification and adjustment time is nigh. Make sure those calculations are running smoother than a greased pig in a county fair.

Embed this code somewhere for debugging, which can be fun in a math-whiz kind of way:

```php
if ($assessed) {
   calculate_grades();
   workshop_phase = 'closed';
}
```

Finally, release grades with flair, even a digital trumpet and banner if you fancy. Let students see the tangible fruits of their labor. And don’t forget to encourage post-workshop reflection—a step often overlooked but invaluable.

### Reflecting on the Journey

Thinking back to our cup of ambition years, setting up a workshop once felt like fitting square pegs into round holes. But with experience and a bit of heartfelt guidance from colleagues, we mastered the art of Moodle Workshop. These digital peer reviews created a notable shift in how students perceived feedback, gradually seeing it not as critique but as the next step in a shared learning voyage.

In conclusion, our foray into Moodle Workshop was much like venturing into the unknown—daunting at first, but ultimately rewarding and a whole lot of memorable. Our hopes are that you'll find your journey just as enriching. Remember, Moodle’s workshop isn't just a tool; it's a stage, a library, a community garden—a place where connections form and learners flourish. Greta, may she continue to inspire us, was right all along.

Let us embrace this tool, breathe life into it, and give our students the opportunity to shine with peer-reviewed brilliance. And who knows? Maybe one day, a student will pay it forward and share their own Moodle tale.
