# Building Predictive Models Using QlikView

Let me take you back, just for a moment, to the time when we first tried our hand at something audacious: building predictive models using QlikView. Picture this—an ordinary Tuesday morning, sipping on lukewarm coffee, fragments of a stale muffin on the keyboard, when Julie from the analytics team said, "We should try doing something different. How about predictive models with QlikView?" Her words hung in the air like a mischievous ghost. We all paused, looked at her, then each other, and just like that, the gauntlet was thrown.

## The Urge to Predict

To give you some context, it wasn't our first rodeo with analytics—oh no, not by a long shot. We'd wrangled data before, arm wrestling stubborn spreadsheets that refused to bend to our will. But this—this was something else. Predictive models promised foresight, almost like peering into a digital crystal ball, and QlikView was our trusty sidekick.

### Step 1: Getting Acquainted with QlikView

First things first, you have to let QlikView know who you are and what you want. Install it—just download from the website, no dark alley meetings kind of stuff—and dive into its familiar but exciting interface. Think of yourself as Dr. Frankenstein, bringing your prediction model to life, but with less gothic flair and more analytical clean lines.

Remember how Julie said, "It should be as exciting as going to Disneyland!" when she was setting up her first ever dashboard? It wasn't. There were more screams of frustration than cheers of excitement at that time. But installation? It’s intuitive. Let QlikView's installation wizard guide you—it wants to help, really.

### Step 2: The Data Dilemma

And then there was the data. We didn't just throw a tantrum because our datasets were stubbornly staying behind file types we couldn't open without multiple clicks. No, we became data whisperers. You import your data into QlikView—Excel, SQL databases—and it becomes like magic, transforming into storytelling elements that beg for a narrative arc.

#### Example Data Load Script

```plaintext
LOAD
    ProductID,
    ProductName,
    Quantity,
    Price
FROM
    Products_data.xlsx
(ooxml, embedded labels, table is Sheet1);
```

Seeing data appear in QlikView was like watching as a Polaroid developed—colors and shapes slowly taking form, a little hazy at first, but mesmerizing in its inevitability.

### Step 3: The Data Model

Now, models. They sound super techy and intimidating, kind of like getting a new boss. Let's demystify. Build relationships. Yes, exactly like speed dating—but with data tables. The aim is to create a star schema—a simple, easy-to-understand hierarchy. You want your data to converse smoothly, without awkward pauses.

We'd gather around Julie's screen and play the guessing game: "Which table kisses which?" It was geeky fun. Here's how you build a basic association model:

#### Example Data Model Script

```plaintext
Table_Products:
LOAD
    ProductID,
    ProductName
FROM
    Products_data.xlsx;

Table_Sales:
LOAD
    SaleID,
    ProductID,
    Quantity,
    SaleDate
FROM
    Sales_data.xlsx;

LEFT JOIN (Table_Products)
LOAD
    ProductID,
    Price
FROM
    Products_pricing.xlsx;
```

Those associations, once established, started talking to each other at cocktail parties, creating a rich tapestry of interconnectedness.

### Step 4: Advanced Analytics and Expressions

So, what did we do next with all this babbling data? We taught it tricks—like the kind a clever dog does for treats. We wrote expressions, defined variables—essentially, it was like choreographing a dance for numbers. Correlations, regressions, you name it, we let QlikView munch on it.

#### Example Expressions

Try this one for basic regression:

```plaintext
LinReg_Sales:
LOAD
    SalesAmount,
    Date,
    LinReg(Amount, Date) as PredictedSales
RESIDENT Sales_data;
```

Turning data into predictions? Oh, it was a rollercoaster of emotions. Our team, our merry band of analysts, would get giddy with excitement. We’d swap tales of triumph and tribulation over donut breaks.

### Step 5: Results and Insight Stories

And then, that moment. The model was complete, the numbers danced like they never had before. It was time for the grand reveal! Imagine the suspense of opening night in a theater packed to the rafters. Fingers crossed, breaths held, drumming of fingers on the wooden table.

Making sense of those model outputs was our climax. Whether it was increased sales predictions or insights into customer behavior like, why on Earth Bob keeps buying spatulas every third Tuesday—the satisfaction was palpable. We saw our efforts breathing life into figures, meaningful insights emerging like phoenixes out of the ashes of mundane data entries.

### Step 6: Share and Iterate

Our final steps felt akin to passing around a beloved book club pick, making sure everyone got a turn to revel in our creation. We shared reports, dashboards—leading to more discussions, more insights, more questions. It was alive, evolving, like a good story never quite completed.

Here's where we used sections access control:

```plaintext
Section Access;
LOAD * INLINE [
    ACCESS, USERID, PASSWORD
    ADMIN, ADMIN, ADMINPWD
    USER, USER1, USER1PWD
];

LOAD USERID as NTNAME
RESIDENT UserDetails;
```

Of course, we repeated these steps, refining, tweaking, adapting our models to new insights, thriving on that learning cycle—I reckon it’s the never-ending curiosity that kept us going.

## Final Thoughts

In hindsight, our adventure with QlikView was more than just building predictive models. It was a journey of discovery, of laughter—the "wow" moments—compounded by shared challenges and eventual wisdom. Kind of like finding your first grey hair and embracing it, after the initial panic.

Julie’s idea, though bold, taught us that diving into the unknown could be as rewarding as it was nerve-wracking. It's not just about making predictions—it's about finding a narrative beneath layers of cold data and sharing that with the world. It's about human connections, even through the vast digital landscape of zeros and ones.

So, dear reader, I say to you—take your teammates, your data, your sense of curiosity—and give predicting with QlikView a whirl. You never know the story your data might be yearning to tell.
