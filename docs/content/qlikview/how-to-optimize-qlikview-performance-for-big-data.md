# How to Optimize QlikView Performance for Big Data

It was precisely ten minutes before the presentation was to kick off. The kind of nerves where you couldn’t tell if it was the coffee or the anxiety making your heart race. The conference room was a landscape of anticipatory stares. We, the self-proclaimed maestros of data visualization, stood poised to display our QlikView dashboard. We had minutely crafted a data masterpiece that promised to make even the most hardened of analysts weep with joy—or so we thought. You see, what followed was a display not so different from a dud firework. Our splendid dashboard spluttered and stalled under the weight of the big data we'd packed into it. Not the best moment, I'll tell you.

In our seemingly never-ending quest to conquer data—and dodge performance woes—we learned a few secrets (some might call them magic tricks) to optimize QlikView performance. Let’s wander through that garden of insight together, shall we?

## The Tale of Efficient Data Modeling

Remember the old saying: “A stitch in time saves nine”? Well, when it comes to QlikView, crafting a competent data model is akin to setting the foundation of a skyscraper. If it’s shaky, everything comes crashing down. Here's how we maneuvered through this labyrinth with grace—mostly.

### The Art of Shooting Ducks That Aren’t in Your Pond

Begin by immersing yourself in the wonder of the data itself. Remember that messy blend of unrelated tables, like some bizarre smörgåsbord that never quite filled you up? That’s what poor data modeling feels like. 

**Step 1: Identify Critical Data Elements**

Isolate the data fields that are absolutely essential to your analysis. Can you zoom out and contemplate what is crucial and what merely clutters the scene? Separate the wheat from the chaff, my friends.

**Step 2: Simplify Data Relationships**

Reside comfortably in the thought that fewer relationships between tables mean a happier model. Trust me on this one. Whenever possible, flatten your data model. Concatenate data into a single “master” table—like merging all your laundry into a single load. This reduces the time QlikView spends hop-skipping between tables.

Human note: I once convinced an entire project team to streamline our data model, and the sheer joy of watching load times plummet was like watching a kid down a super-fast slide.

## The Chronicles of Script Optimization

After a hearty dose of data wrangling, let's tumble into the realm where the scripts live. Here, it’s all about elegance. Graceful scripting keeps your application from transforming into a torpid tortoise.

### Unmasking the Darling of Optimization—The Associative Model

Here’s the scene: thousands of data points, balconies of information, all interconnected like a spider web - nature’s grand design. Here’s where QlikView shines with its associative model.

**Step 3: Optimize with Incremental Loads**

When your datasets befriend millions of rows lovingly, incremental loading becomes your best buddy. Instead of reloading the entire data set every time—as enjoyable as that sounds—consider loading only the freshest or changed data. Voilà! Instant efficiency.

```sql
// Example incremental load script
concatenate (mainTable)
load *
resident incrementalTable
where not exists(KeyField);
drop table incrementalTable;
```

**Step 4: Prefetch Data**

To expedite processing, warm up the engine by prefetching data into memory. It’s like laying out outfits for the week rather than rifling through your closet every morning. Undoubtedly, it saves time.

**Step 5: Variable Management—The Unsung Hero**

Use variables to simplify and optimize expressions. They’re like secret weapons that make complex calculations dance in unison.

```qv
SET vCurrentYear = Year(Today());
LOAD
    Sales,
    $(vCurrentYear) AS Year
FROM
    MyDataSource.qvd (qvd);
```

Each time I barter code for variables, it’s like savoring a victory chocolate hidden at the back of the fridge.

## Adventuring into Data Reduction

There was once a time on a Tuesday (or was it a Wednesday?) when reducing data to speed up our dashboard seemed counterintuitive. It’s like purposely leaving out the most appealing characters from a story. But, oh, dear readers, it makes a world of difference.

### Slimming Down the Gargantuan Data Monster

**Step 6: Apply Section Access**

Lock uninvolved data away from unauthorized hands — and users who need not see everything. This isn’t just about performance. It’s about security. Strangely satisfying, isn’t it?

**Step 7: Employ Document Segmentation**

Another secret from behind the curtain: break your QlikView document into fewer complex components—or sheets, rather than cramming everything into one all-consuming dashboard. It’s kinder on memory and gives your users room to breathe.

## Polishing Performance with Effective Expressions

The synergy of our dashboards often boils down to the elegance of our expressions, doesn't it now?

### The Mission of Optimization: Better Expressions, Better Outcomes

**Step 8: Minimize IF Statements**

An intricate tapestry of nested IFs will eventually halt progress. Oh, it’s such a temptation. Instead, leverage Set Analysis for calculations, which is QlikView’s special way of saying, "Let’s just be smarter about this."

```qv
Sum({<Year = {$(=Year(TODAY()))}>} Sales)
```

**Step 9: Aggregate With Care**

When in doubt, aggregate. However, do it prudently. Only aggregate when necessary—and at higher levels. This way, your app doesn’t break a sweat over each data morsel.

## A Final Bow to Maintenance and Monitoring

As time marches forward—and it surely does—keep those dashboards pruned, pampered, and optimized, dear friends.

**Step 10: Schedule Regular Performance Audits**

Take it like scheduling a check-up with your dentist. Regular checks remove little issues before they morph into hideous hiccups. Tools like QlikView Governance Dashboard can provide that vital overview.

Would you venture to say we learned more from our disastrous dashboard debut than we ever would have from success? Within each section of our narrative, these lessons bubbled up at unexpected times—like the fairest of weathered guides coaxing us along.

So there we were, a little older, perhaps a bit wiser, yet spiraled with this rare delight of having conquered the beast. With arms interlinked in camaraderie and a handful of practical insights, optimizing QlikView performance for big data transcended from necessity to art. Let's continue crafting stories of success one optimized dashboard at a time.
