# Comparing QlikView and Qlik Sense

---

### A Nostalgic Data Adventure

Gather round, dear colleagues, for a tale that begins in the bustling hum of our company’s tech den. There I was, an unsuspecting data enthusiast, about to embark on a journey that only the brave at heart dream of—comparing two behemoths of business intelligence: QlikView and Qlik Sense. It was one of those moments that mark the end of ignorance and begin the pursuit of knowledge, shaping the very essence of our analytical fraternity.

Our boss, Lisa, had a penchant for dramatic unveilings and, with a glint in her eye, tasked us with mastering the nuanced dance between these data twins. "Whichever speaks magic into our analytical endeavors," she said, waving excitedly as if holding a wand.

The following narrates our escapade, step by step, trial by trial, insight by insight, through the captivating world of Qlik. Let’s dig into this delightful—or torturous, as Sam never failed to remind us—comparison!

### Setting the Stage

**Understanding the Basics**

Picture us, crowded around Sam’s cramped cubicle, scratched heads reflecting fluorescent lights. “QlikView,” Sam read aloud from an article that had clearly been bookmarked since 2008. “The veteran, the legend, the grandma in your tech stack. It’s robust, reliable, but sometimes needs a sprinkle of love and care.”

Qlik Sense, on the other hand, was the rebellious teenager. Agile, intuitive, and perhaps a bit too modern for its own good. The age-old question: stability versus agility.

**QlikView’s Power and Quirks**

With bated breath, we stepped into QlikView’s labyrinth. “First, you need scripts,” Lisa said, tapping her keyboard rhythmically. Structured Query Language, the ancient tongue of databases, held the key to unlocking QlikView’s treasures.

```sql
LOAD
  field1,
  field2
FROM
  sourcefile.qvd
```

Brimming with peculiar quirks, QlikView mirrored a choose-your-own-adventure novel. “It’s not just about what you write but how you write it,” remarked Sam, pointing at the curly braces in the script that determined our fate.

QlikView felt like learning magic spells, where each incantation reflected a balance between data input and the wizardry at play beneath the surface. It wasn’t the gentlest of tools, - it was demanding, impatient, and yet satisfying when executed with flourish.

**Qlik Sense’s Ballet of Simplicity**

Next, we waded into the serene, minimalist pool of Qlik Sense. It greeted us with open arms, devoid of the curly braces menace. “Here, no scripting massacre,” Lisa chuckled, deftly interacting with the intuitive drag-and-drop interface that appealed to the visually inclined among us.

Qlik Sense was about flow, elegance, simplicity. Like painting with vibrant data swatches, we craved dashboards that sang in harmony, replacing our discontent with serene joy as we merged datasets without requiring a degree in cryptography.

This was not lost on Sam, who delighted in its automation – the formulas here felt like skipping a stone across a tranquil lake compared to the labor-intensive chiseling of QlikView.

### Battle of Dashboards

**Craftsmanship Versus Creativity**

Now, imagine the room, calendar pages peeled away, as artworks of dashboards and visualization spring forth from our tenacious endeavors. QlikView, our classical sculptor, allowed meticulous artisanship, with layers of detail and a maze of triggers that would make even Leonardo da Vinci nod with approval. But therein lay the conundrum: the more elaborate the fresco, the more we questioned... "Is it really necessary?"

We toyed with pulleys and levers, dynamic dashboards that gasped and groaned under the complexity of their formulas. Meanwhile, Qlik Sense, like an ethereal Gandalf, invisibly held sway over the realm of creativity sans chaos.

Its dynamic storytelling with self-service data visualizations brought our analysis to life. “Hold on, is this a data dance?” Sam queried, eyes gleaming while he shaped the narrative with a few effortless swipes. It was a revelation that placed Qlik Sense in the hands of anyone keen on spinning a data tale.

**Crafting Calculations**

One day, venturing further into the depths of calculation jungle, we wrestled with Qlik’s syntax – it was like speaking Klingon with a dash of Swedish Chef mixed in. “In QlikView, everything revolves around `Set Analysis`,” Lisa elaborated, her fingers whirling across keyboards frantically.

```plaintext
sum({<Year={2021}>} Sales)
```

“Oh boy,” we confessed, grappling with commas and braces and tribunals of selection criteria. But soon, smiles spread cheek to cheek as codes translated into seamless dashboards. 

In Qlik Sense, there was no need for linguistic acrobatics. It translated everything with soulful ease, forgiving our novice mistakes. We found ourselves embracing its language as one embraces newfound literacy.

### The Art of Data Governance

**Handle with Care**

Subsequently, governance emerged as the noble sheriff in our data frontier. QlikView granted us superpowers with layers upon layers of control, maintaining strict hierarchies and rulebooks etched on stone tablets – formidable yet often constricting.

“Here,” Sam alluded as we maneuvered, “we’ve a cathedral of security, where user roles and access reign supreme.” It was the very foundation of data integrity, though often leaving us entangled in its restrictive web.

On the opposite spectrum, Qlik Sense donned the cloak of egalitarianism. It was a sanctuary of policy, easy rollout, and seamless updates across the land. No queens or kings; just one big family of democratic data access.

**A Brave New World of Extensions**

Inevitably, our journey would loop back to extensions – those nifty widgets of wonder. QlikView was akin to a curmudgeon, requiring us to jump hoops and ladders to align our vision with its reality.

Meanwhile, Qlik Sense beckoned us into a marketplace of gadgets and gizmos aplenty, extensions as colorful as candies on a playground, which only widened the crevasse between mediocre analysis and data wizardry.

### Reflecting on Joy and Discovery

As we meandered through endless arrays of numbers and charts, exploring the intrinsic beauty in both QlikView and Qlik Sense, we realized that it was a journey worth taking. Not simply about choosing which tool lay in our hands, but visiting the paths, detours, and bridges that taught us more than mere syntax or interface. 

Together, we reveled in immense learning, emboldened by the knowledge and experiences garnered side by side, underpinned by an admiration for the data storytelling art.

“Honest introspection,” Lisa often reminded us as stars twinkled into the welcoming sky, “is not in finding the right tool alone but in evolving, as artisans do, drawing strength through wisdom."

So, dear comrades in data, take heed of our tale, for in the wanderings and wonderings of comparing QlikView and Qlik Sense, we uncovered more about shared bonds than mere software prowess. In the heart of progress, we found more of each other—brighter, wiser, all-knowing... or blissfully unaware, all at once.

Cheers to many more escapades, with humor and heart on this journey through data's endless realms!
