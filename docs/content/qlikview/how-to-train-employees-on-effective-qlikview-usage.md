# How to Train Employees on Effective QlikView Usage

## The Awkward Moment in the Office

It was a Tuesday morning, the kind where the office lights felt less harsh and hope was still perfumed in the air. Our team gathered around a round table – one of those not big enough for the room, and during the meeting, our manager, Lucy, unveiled the gem of analytic tools: QlikView. Her excitement was contagious but watching the blank stares from my colleagues, it was as clear as daylight that we needed some serious training. Fast forward to today, and here we are, sharing how we turned from QlikView-struck novices into savvy data wizards. This journey was rich with trial and error, fueled by coffee, and peppered with moments of epiphany and chaos. 

## Ignition: Setting the Stage

Remember when we knew nothing about QlikView but had plenty of questions? We started with the most essential first step: **Understanding 'Why'**. We sat down – sofas and bean chairs in the break room – and dissected why QlikView was chosen. It was all about visualization and agility, marrying data with insights in an elegant tango. Someone uttered, “It’s like a paintbrush for data!” Yes, exactly that. Perspectives shifted once everyone saw the tool not as a task but as a craft we could master. It’s funny how everything becomes easier once purpose meets understanding.

A lesson here: before diving into the nitty-gritty, ensure every team member knows the 'why'. It keeps everyone rowing in the same direction when the storm hits hard.

## Hands-on Training: The Fun Begins

We started with a fun exercise. **Create a Mock Dashboard** – it’s like a sandbox, freeing us to make mistakes without consequences. There were charts flying around like confetti, but behind the chaos, understanding was slowly crystallizing. It reminded me of childhood art classes where we had unlimited blank pages to mess up before getting that one perfect stroke. 

**Step 1: Install QlikView Desktop**
1. First things first: download and install QlikView Desktop. Like brewing the perfect cup of coffee, everything starts here. Visit the official Qlik website for the latest version.
2. Place the installer on your desktop—just for easy access—and double-click the file. It’s like the mysterious door leading to the magical world you've been waiting to explore.
3. Follow the installation wizard instructions. Hit next, next, and yes, you are a wizard too now!

**Step 2: Data Import**
- Here's where the magic happens: importing data. Think of this as choosing the ingredients for your signature dish.
- Ask Jim from the IT team for data essentials, or download the sample data set from Qlik – avoid horror data stories at all costs.
- Open QlikView, go to the **File** menu, select **Edit Script**, and import your data file, pretending it’s Sunday morning and you’re browsing for brunch recipes.

## Learning by Doing: Getting Crafty with QlikView

**Step 3: Creating Visualizations**
- This is where the fun starts; call this the decorating part. Go Kardashian on those charts!
- Use the **Chart Wizard** to create visualizations. Choose from an array of bar charts, pie charts, line charts, scatter plots – a buffet for your data taste buds.
- Roger, the guy who speaks fluent chart, suggested a pie chart to see where our sales were coming from. Enlightening, isn’t it?

**Step 4: Interactivity and Insights**
- Interactivity is king! Enable selection and drill-down features in your charts. It’s akin to peeling back layers on a perfectly baked croissant—endless delight.
- Provide filters and sliders, allowing users to interact with data. Suddenly, it’s not just numbers; it’s a story waiting to be narrated.
- Discuss insights with your team, encourage ‘aha’ moments like when discovering that giraffes sleep standing up. Who knew till someone clicked on Africa!

## The Group Guru Session

Lucy organized a series of group sessions which became our sanctuary of wisdom. Yes, real people talking in real rooms! We all flocked there because there's something about humans gathered in rooms that beats online tutorials. Everyone brought their own discoveries and failures, sharing like we’re at a potluck dinner. Those sessions were gold and transformed confusion into clarity, and strangers into allies.

**Step 5: Solve Real Business Questions**
1. Pick one business question. Let’s not pretend we can all multitask like an octopus chef.
2. Use QlikView to answer these questions. It’s like finding that one special ingredient that makes the stew perfect.
3. Present findings to the team. Make it theatrical – wow them with data storytelling.

## The Playful Assessment

Who doesn’t love games? We certainly needed a playful break. Enter—the **Data Quiz Jam**. True, quizzes can form the pillars of learning. So, we transformed assessments into a game night type-of-session. We’d put teams together and quiz each other, laughter echoing down the halls as we terribly failed or gloriously won. Failing didn’t hurt—learning hid in those failures.

**Step 6: Evaluation and Feedback**
- Create a checklist: Can your team import data, create charts, understand basic scripting? This is not a government exam!
- Gather feedback: An honest, possibly brutally honest conversation over lunch. Comments like, "I hate the scatter plots" – valuable feedback!
- Reiterate and improve – because practice doesn’t make perfect, practice makes better.

## Taking It Forward: Our QlikView Culture

Have you ever noticed how cultures form around shared tools and practices? It happened with us and QlikView. As everyone became accustomed to the dashboards, a culture of data-centric thinking sprouted. No longer were decisions shrouded in mystery, but visibly driven by data. Our journey wasn’t just about using QlikView; it was about evolving how we view data and decision-making.

**Step 7: Encourage Ongoing Learning**
- Set up a QlikView buddies system. Like pen friends but nerdier and without the pen.
- Keep updated with Qlik’s latest enhancements. Treat future updates like the premiere of the next Star Wars movie.
- Celebrate successes, no matter how small. Ring the mini-bell with every new dashboard—our cheesy tradition that stuck around.

## Looking Back at the Odyssey

As I sit on the same round table where our journey began, I realize that training isn’t about cramming information, it’s about transformation. We became a team not just proficient in QlikView but one that could unlock insights and create data-legends within the realms of our roles. It brought unexpected joy, camaraderie, and the satisfying clunk of jigsaw pieces locking into place.

So, should you embark on your own QlikView training journey—do it with shared laughter, embrace the discomfort of learning something new, and remember to keep it real. Trust me, the view at the top is worth every step of the climb.

**Code Snippet: Basic Scripting Guide**

```plaintext
LOAD
    Field1,
    Field2,
    Field3
FROM
    [YourDataFile.xlsx]
    (ooxml, embedded labels, table is Sheet1);

```

It’s one of those wasn’t-that-hard moments, really.

By the end, what matters most is not how well we know QlikView, but what we can visualize and solve with it. Let's ace data with style and firm resolve.
