# Common Mistakes to Avoid When Using QlikView

We all have our formidable tales, and here’s ours—it involves a tiny, innocuous checkbox and a wild goose chase that lasted hours. Bella, Tim, and I were tied to our chairs, streaming into the depths of a QlikView dashboard that refused to reveal insights. The culprit? A single misguided selection. It was a surprisingly delightful revelation, one that set us wondering: what else are we tripping over without realizing?

### The Tale of Missteps: Data Loading Debacle

Let’s start our narrative on a brisk Wednesday morning—lattes in hand—where Bella, with her flair for setting things in motion, eagerly loaded some data sets. Or so she thought. Here’s the kicker: her clicked-unchecked-boxed blunder caused the data to dance out of sync. Rows mismatched like awkward siblings at a family reunion. Had she omitted to check the script execution order? You bet.

1. **Establish a Consistent Data Load Order**
   - When we load data in QlikView, our golden rule is clairvoyance—predict what should go where. Select the Load Script Editor from the dropdown menu (∵ top left tools trinket). Open your script and review the data sources’ order meticulously.
   - Ensure you reference variables and tables in the correct sequence. This avoids arbitrary chaos.
   - Save, load, and skip heart palpitations, unsurprised by what transforms onscreen.

#### Finding the Error: Bella’s Lightbulb Moment

Not one to abandon elegance, Bella exclaimed, “Why not test smaller data sets first?” Testing smaller data batches alleviates the pain of tiresome loads. We wondered why no one underscored this in neon sooner.

### Visualization Vexations: The Chart Conundrum

Flash forward to Friday—most folks are unwinding, but not Tim. He’s popped a vein over his bar chart stubbornly staying monochrome. His envisioned vibrant tapestry of insights? Reduced to grayscale melancholy.

2. **Harness the Power of Dynamic Colours**
   - Click on your intended chart. Look marvelous, my dear pie graph.
   - Head to ‘Properties’ → ‘Colors’ tab. Specify conditions using expressions—something more dynamic than a brick wall, please.
   - `if(Sales > 10000, green(), red())` – Tim’s simple yet sublime flash of genius code function—brought color (literally) into his world.

#### Why It Matters: The Sparkling Chart Saga

Every blip and dash in your visualization ought to reflect something insightful. After all, nobody enjoys reading data that could bore an insomniac into slumber. 

### Overloaded Dashboards: The Glut of Knowledge

By Monday, I faced a dashboard resembling a control panel—buttons and charts burgeoning with little meaningful insight. Here’s where less is truly more.

3. **Declutter the Dashboard**
   - Identify your core audience and focus aspects first. Is it the top execs or the analytical number-crunchers? Design accordingly.
   - Hunt down bottleneck areas. Every element demands attention like a child tugging at your sleeve. Identify and prioritize.
   - Use the ‘Conditional Show’ in layout properties. Hide secondary info till summoned.

#### Insights from the Trenches: Mineful of Gold

Too much data, too fast, is akin to trying to sip from a firehose. A rich, meaningful story requires prowess and simplicity in storytelling.

### Scripting Struggles: The Mismatch Melee

Onward to the twilight of our week. This conflict involved mismatched joins. Of course, with me at the helm, it was clear we were stirring chaos—left joins screaming for sanity.

4. **Align Your Joins with Precision**
   - Comb through your script. How do tables link? Merge datasets using `JOIN`, `CONCATENATE`, or `KEEP` with necessary tweakings.
   - Let’s dance with scripting syntax: `LOAD` and `Join` to maintain harmony.
   - You might embrace the left-join mantra—gently embrace techniques advisable for otherworldly exploration.

#### The Magical Alignment: Connecting the Dots

Linking tables badly is like patching random puzzle pieces to form a masterpiece—or straight-out mess—creating illusions rather than solutions.

### Performance Pitfalls: Sluggish Symphony

By Saturday, sluggish processing performances crept in—something us mortals despised. QlikView wheezed under cumbersome loads. Bella tapped away, hair in a bun of exasperation.

5. **Optimize with Sense**
   - Consider what’s inclined to slow your dashboard—it’s mostly unneeded calculations.
   - Implement calculated dimensions sparingly. They snag the performance metrics.
   - Test performance metrics — multiple hands make work light—their collaboration more so. Identify choke points.

#### The Final Flourish: Flick of Efficiency

We delved deep. To keep QlikView hummin’ like a charm, trim the proverbial fat— pare down data sets. The guardians of time and bandwidth would applaud.

### Conclusion: The Shared Dance of Discovery

So, there we were, looking at a polished and well-oiled QlikView dashboard. Instead of the foreboding tool it once was—happy with triumph—we laughed over another story archived into our expanding database of experiences. Here’s to fewer mistakes and more ‘Aha!’ moments in the tangled web of code and creativity. Because let’s face it: We’re all learning. One checkbox at a time.
