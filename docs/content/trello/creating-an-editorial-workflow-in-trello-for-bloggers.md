# Creating an Editorial Workflow in Trello for Bloggers

Sometimes, life hands you unexpected revelations in the most mundane of places. It was during a late-night coffee run, aimlessly staring at raindrops racing down a window, that I realized Jesse and I needed a better system for our blog. We'd been coasting on chaos and adrenaline for months. Our creative process was a beautiful mess – with emphasis on the mess. Post-it notes plastered like abstract wallpaper around the office, unfinished drafts lurking in forgotten corners of Google Docs, and ideas evaporating like summer rain on hot pavement.

It was time to get serious. Trello caught our attention. We needed structure, a roadmap through the colorful jumble of our thoughts. It seemed like the perfect antidote to our editorial disarray.

## 1. The Vision: Mapping Out Our Needs

Remember when you’re on a road trip and realize you’re lost because “intuitive navigation” doesn’t apply in the real world? Jesse and I knew exactly how that felt. We needed a clear path to follow. With Trello, the possibilities seemed as endless as the directions on a compass.

### Establish the Goals

Before diving into Trello, we scribbled down what we wanted: more time for creativity, fewer frantic messages at 2 a.m., actually publishing content when we promised we would. We needed structure without sacrificing flair – a delicate balancing act, akin to juggling flaming torches while riding a unicycle.

**Reflective Step**: Think about what you want from your editorial process. A smoother workflow? Better collaboration options? Define your blogging goals and let them guide you.

### Decide on the Board Structure

And so we deliberated over coffee (which Jesse insists fuels the blogging universe). Should we break things down by stages – ideation, drafting, editing, ready to publish? Or maybe try categorizing by theme first? Ah, choices, choices. After much caffeine-induced debate, we settled on creating a separate board for each month, each containing lists that reflected the stages of our process. The versatility was like discovering the Swiss Army knife of workflow tools.

**Reflective Step**: Decide what structure works best for you. In Trello, you can shape your boards to fit your unique process. Flexibility is your friend.

## 2. Building Blocks: Getting Down to Brass Tacks

Physical Post-it notes were now a thing of the past as we faced the screen, our blank Trello board brimming with potential. Laying digital bricks one by one, we began to organize our blogging empire… one card at a time.

### Set Up Your Lists

We started with lists. To-do, Doing, Done – the classic formula felt like trying on an old jacket that still fit perfectly. Over time, we added “Backlog” for the brainwaves that often struck when least expected – in the shower or during Jesse’s attempts to cook gourmet meals using the microwave. Custom labels added that bit of pizzazz, coloring our thoughts into distinct categories such as “Urgent,” “Research Required,” and “Ideas I Had in My Sleep.”

**Reflective Step**: Create lists that reflect your unique process and style. Use labels for easy organization.

### Cards: The Building Blocks

With our lists in place, it was card time. Oh, how we relished dragging those empty cards from list to list like puzzle pieces finding their home. Adding deadlines, checklists, attachments, and notes became a custom. We attached drafts, linked documents, specified word counts, and left comments. Do cards eliminate chaos? Maybe not entirely, but they sure guide it into a semblance of order.

### Automate Where Possible

We discovered Butler. Not a person, unfortunately, but a Trello feature – automation that shuffles cards, not dusters. This nifty feature let us automate tasks, like moving a card to “Editing” when a checklist was completed. It's like our Trello board developed a sense of intuition.

**Reflective Step**: Utilize Trello’s automation tools to lighten your load. Focus on the magic of creation.

## 3. Collaboration: Let’s Work Together, Like Peanut Butter and Jelly

Once upon a time, coordinating as a team was like synchronizing box steps with two left feet. Trello changed that particular dance for us.

### Assigning Tasks

Jesse and I could now assign cards to each other with a few clicks. There’s something satisfying about toggling responsibilities at the speed of thought, leaving less room for dropped balls and pointing fingers. It’s a sympathetic symphony of collaboration.

### Communication

Us bloggers? We’re a chatty bunch. Trello’s integrated comment section kept our conversations tidy. No more endless email threads or vague kitchen-table conversations to capture. Plus, a little emoji action here and there doesn’t hurt team morale.

**Reflective Step**: Use Trello to streamline communication. It enhances collaboration among team members.

### Sharing Boards

Once a secretive duo, we began sharing boards with guest writers and editors. Giving others access felt like opening the chocolate box we usually kept for ourselves – but with less guilt and more productivity. We set permissions, ensuring everyone knew their place and things didn’t descend into digital anarchy.

**Reflective Step**: Expand your blog’s potential by sharing your Trello board and delegating. It takes a team.

## 4. Review and Reflect: The Post-Publish Routine

And so, the blog post saw the light of day, now wasn’t that a fine thing! Yet, the process didn’t stop at publishing. An encore was due.

### Analytics and Feedback

We created Trello cards for ongoing projects like "Analytics Check" every month. Looking at what worked and what didn’t helped us improve continuously. We recorded feedback directly onto Trello boards – a historical archive of sorts, chronicling our triumphs and, yes, the duds too.

### Retrospectives

Jesse and I made it a point to hold monthly coffee-fueled retrospectives. Our Trello board became this map, with milestones and memories sticking out like signposts along a trail. And, in those moments, we laughed at our foibles and celebrated our growth.

**Reflective Step**: Use Trello for reflection on what’s worked. Learn and adapt continuously.

In time, our board transformed into more than a tool – it became an ecosystem for our creativity, a sanctuary from chaos. The world spun with ideas no longer lost, but captured, nurtured, and sent into the wild, armed with structure and purpose. As we sit here, looking back on our journey, Jesse and I feel a buoyant gratitude for Trello and for the process. So drink your coffee (or tea, we don’t judge), and dive into this digital roundabout, this living, breathing editorial wonderland. It could be the catalyst for your creative awakening.
