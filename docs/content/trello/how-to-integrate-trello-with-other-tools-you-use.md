# How to Integrate Trello with Other Tools You Use

You know that rare moment where everything clicks into place like it’s supposed to? That was us, sitting in a tiny café on a rainy Thursday afternoon, sipping on what may very well have been the seventh cup of coffee while staring at an endless stream of tasks that danced mockingly across our digital screens. We all have been there, haven't we? Staring at Trello cards, hoping they would miraculously handle themselves. This is the story of how those cards came to life by integrating Trello with the myriad of tools swimming around our virtual workspaces.

## The Eureka Moment: Finding the Right Tools

It began as most serendipitous discoveries do — with utter exasperation. There we were, waging war against an ever-mounting heap of tasks. The deadline shadow seemed longer, darker. Frank, our resident cynic, clasped his laptop shut with a signature dramatic flair. "There must be a way to make them talk to each other!" he declared. And thus, a journey of tool communion began.

### Integration with Slack

Did I ever tell you about the time we nearly missed an important deadline because half the team was unaware the deadline existed? Classic, right? Slack to the rescue. Integrating Trello with Slack was like turning on the lights at a surprise party – sudden clarity.

Here's the lowdown on making that connection:

1. **Find the Trello app in Slack's App Directory**: We typed "Trello" in that little searching area. Praise be, there it was.
   
2. **Add it to your workspace**: One click. Boom, done.

3. **Authorize Trello to Slack**: Here was the charming bit where it asked us to give permissions. We agreed, albeit grudgingly – like signing a peace treaty.

4. **Link Trello boards to Slack channels**: This was the wizardry part. We simply used `/trello link [board-url]` in our Slack channel, and voilà! Magic.

5. **Adjust notifications**: We entered `/trello help` to see all commands. We then tailored the notification settings just like we customized our pizzas, sparingly but purposefully.

Now, our Trello cards sang their notifications through Slack. Frank even started referring to it as our 'digital assistant,' still with a hint of sarcasm.

### Google Calendar: The Timekeeper’s Friend

Imagine missing a client meeting because you scheduled two at the same time. Nightmare fuel. Then, along came Google Calendar integrations.

1. **Power-Up Trello with Calendar**: It was like dressing up Trello with a snazzy hat. We activated the Calendar Power-Up from Trello's Power-Up menu.

2. **Create iCalendar link**: In the Calendar settings, we grabbed the iCalendar URL like it was a rare Pokémon just waiting to be caught.

3. **Add to Google Calendar**: Over at Google Calendar, the ‘Add Calendar’ option gleamed invitingly. We pasted the iCalendar URL there.

As a result, our schedules transformed into plotted journeys, each task fitting into time-slots like Tetris pieces. And not a single appointment was missed again. Frank called it a miracle; I pointed to the coffee.

### Email Integration with Gmail

If email could transform into a diligent, helpful assistant, that was the dream, not the reality. But what if you could email tasks straight into your Trello board?

1. **Enable Email-to-board setting in Trello**: We dove into Trello's settings like explorers uncovering ancient legends. There it was: 'Email-to-board settings.'

2. **Customize and memorize email address for Trello board**: We received a unique email address. Trello morphed into a digital postmaster.

3. **Forward tasks from email to Trello**: Emails sprouted wings, soaring straight to our Trello cards as tasks with a mere forward click!

Suddenly, those nasty little task emails didn't just pile up, cluttering our inboxes like unwanted guests. They found a home. And peace descended upon our inboxes.

### Automation with Zapier

Once upon a time, juggling multiple apps felt like being a circus performer. Enter Zapier, the rings that bind them all.

1. **Create a Zapier account**: Easy as pie – we signed up.

2. **Connect Trello to Zapier**: Within Zapier, we selected Trello as the app to connect.

3. **Set 'trigger' and 'action' events**: We defined triggers (like adding a card) and actions (like adding a calendar event). It was like setting pieces on a chessboard, but without the impending doom.

4. **Test and adjust**: We watched it go. Flawless, like a seasoned ballet dancer performing a plié.

With Zapier, our repetitive tasks tiptoed away into a sea of automation. Each mundane step vanished, leaving space for creative endeavors.

### Time-Tracking with Toggl

"Where does the time go?" Rebecca, our team’s timekeeper, often asked with a perplexed furrow of her brows. Toggl, with its time-sheet wisdom, offered answers.

1. **Set up a Toggl account**: Easy peasy. Toggl greeted us warmly with a sign-up page.

2. **Install Toggl’s Trello extension**: We found a browser extension that was cooler than we expected and connected it straight to Trello.

3. **Start tracking time on Trello cards**: A simple button appeared on each card. Start, stop, start again. Time, finally, was within our grasp.

Rebecca now had her happy trails of numbers and hours, and the invisible veils of time were lifted.

## The Journey’s Impact: A Harmonious Workflow

Reflecting on this endeavor—right there in that cozy café, our hearts full, our task list less—what struck us was how each connection turned chore into chorus. Frank, of course, had his qualms, "I used to love the chaos," he said, though his grin suggested otherwise.

Tasks got done. But we did more than simply get things done. We cultivated our own little digital ecosystem where each tool wasn't just a tool, but an extension of us, our teamwork, and our creativity. It wasn't about lessening the workload, but enriching it with meaning, intention, and—could I say—joy.

As we packed our devices and trooped back into the drizzly afternoon, it wasn't just the caffeine and clarity coursing through our veins. It was the new, integrative way of working that made the promise of tomorrow's tasks - dare we say - a little less daunting and more exciting.

Here's to integrating with intention, friends. May our workflows forever flourish, and may our Trello boards always stay humble.
