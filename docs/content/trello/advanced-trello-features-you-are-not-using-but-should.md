# Advanced Trello Features You Are Not Using But Should

You know, there’s this thing we all do. We find a tool, like Trello, and figure out just enough to get by. But what about when you realize you’ve been using an amazing tool for years and barely scratched the surface? A familiar tale ensnared me when our project team gathered around for our monthly heart-to-heart, known formally as the “status meeting.” Rita, the project manager with an uncanny knack for details, mentioned this Trello power-up she discovered. Her excitement was contagious—everyone's eyes sparkled with sudden curiosity. That moment nudged us to dive deeper into Trello's potential, opening our eyes to a myriad of features waiting patiently in the wings.

## Subtle Joy of Trello Automations

We watched as Rita, with a flourish that could put a magician to shame, showcased how Butler, Trello's automation genie, could untangle the mess of workflows. Imagine our collective shock. We had inadvertently made Trello a playground for chaos, pushing cards around with less coordination than a flock of startled pigeons. Little did we know, a simple command or two offered by Butler could turn our card-moving frenzy into an orchestrated ballet.

To get started, just:

1. Click on the `Automation` button at the top of your Trello board.
2. Select `Create Command`.
3. Choose between `Card button`, `Board button`, `Rule`, and `Scheduled command` to specify what kind of automation you want.
4. Follow the user-friendly wizard to set triggers and actions.

And there it is! A symphony of orderly automation at your fingertips. The thrill of seeing tasks march to their appropriate columns sparked a wave of productive grins around the table.

## The Enigma of Custom Fields

During a coffee break—all meaningful conversations happen over caffeine, don’t they?—Jake from marketing sidled up with news that he, too, had been dabbling in unknown territories of Trello. In hushed tones, he spoke of custom fields as though they were whispered about in circles of mystical Trello elites. These fields, boxes that let us add drop-downs, numbers, and dates, moved beyond the mundane checks and texts, essentially giving every card a personal touch.

We embarked on this curious path by:

1. Enabling the `Custom Fields Power-Up` from the Power-Ups section.
2. Clicking `Show Menu`, then `Power-Ups` to find and enable it.
3. Jumping onto any card and locating `Custom Fields` to start customizing.

Now, our tasks wore mini bios—color-coded for maximum flair, with urgency levels that quivered in anticipation. It was a workmanship revelation, one that filled our Trello boards with a depth we hadn't anticipated.

## Calendar View: Time’s Embrace

Ah, calendars. In every office I’ve known, there’s a romance, a love-hate affair with calendars. Laura, the one who keeps us all sane with her time management tricks, casually remarked about how she started using Trello’s Calendar Power-Up, turning our lists into a timeline tapestry. Faces were skeptical, but Laura, ever patient, nudged us closer to destiny enriched by dates.

Set it up like we're planning a grand mischief:

1. Head to the `Power-Ups` section and search for `Calendar`.
2. Enable this magnificent tool and click `Calendar` to view.
3. Drag tasks onto the calendar to give them a temporal home.

We eased into this new lifestyle, watching our tasks glide from nameless cards to part of a grander plan, a plan that wrapped each deadline in an embrace rather than suffocating us with dread.

## Linking Cards and Boards: A Connected Symphony

As the wind of curiosity swept through our team, Andy, a programmer with an eternal chain of headphones around his neck, exposed another dimension: linking cards across various boards, akin to sending messages in a bottle across a sea of tasks. Suddenly, our isolated islands of information found bridges, and we declared it the age of connected Trello entities.

Unshackle this potential by:

1. Opening the card you wish to link from.
2. Clicking `Attachment` and selecting `Trello` from the menu.
3. Choosing the board and card to link to your current card.
   
Bridges formed, connecting our workflows in a symphony so interconnected that we imagined the meeting room filled with spontaneous orchestral bursts.

## Card Repeater: The Echo of Routine

Seated next to Eva, our human reminder machine, I marveled at how she had managed to personal foil redundancy’s eternal recurrence. Her secret weapon: Trello’s Card Repeater, a feature that, with Zen-like simplicity, ensured routine cards reappeared in a perfectly timed cadence.

It’s astoundingly simple:

1. Enable the `Card Repeater Power-Up`.
2. On any list, select `Repeater Rules` to define when and where these repeat heroes shall emerge.

We realized our weekly tasks would reappear heroically without needing a memory prod or an intricate ritual of digital post-its scribbled late at night.

## Conclusion: The Petit Revelation in Trello Mastery

As we sat there, post-revelation, some munched on the obligatory meeting cookies, others cradled their coffee cups, each basking in the glory of newfound, elegant organization. Our Trello boards had transformed from mundane task jars to dynamic projects filled with a vigour we hadn't thought possible.

We've wandered through a landscape of automations, custom touches, temporal planning, interconnected tasks, and rhythmic repeats. There’s a beautiful madness in unearthing functionalities that brighten up our workspace and, in turn, breathe life into the most wearisome tasks. Let us joyously engage these tools—to make our digital yet deeply human workspaces shine a little brighter, echoing with the sounds of joyful discovery rather than desperate clicking. Here's to Trello and the beautiful chaos it masters!
