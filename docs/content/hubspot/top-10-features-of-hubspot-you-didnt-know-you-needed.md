# Top 10 Features of HubSpot You Didn’t Know You Needed

In the late hours of a tired Wednesday night, while munching on the ambiguous leftovers from earlier in the week, I found myself knee-deep in HubSpot's myriad features. This accidental deep dive wasn't planned - isn't it always the unplanned adventures that become the most memorable? It was like discovering a secret room in a house you've lived in for years. And in that slapdash adventure, we found some gems that you, dear reader, absolutely need in your life but probably had no idea existed. Let's journey together through ten features that are bound to change how you use HubSpot.

## 1. **Social Media Monitoring**

I remember Tina from marketing - the one always buried in spreadsheets and post-its. She discovered social media monitoring in HubSpot by accident. Her face lit up like she’d found the golden ticket.

Social Media Monitoring allows you to keep track of brand mentions, keywords, and competitor activity across various platforms. Imagine sipping your coffee, while this feature does all the heavy lifting, scanning the digital noise for the bits that matter to you.

To set it up, head over to the social tools in your HubSpot dashboard, select the monitoring tab, and input keywords, hashtags, or direct mentions. Voila! Instant awareness of your social reputation.

## 2. **Sequences**

Ah, sequences. Greg from sales had this bad habit of forgetting follow-ups - until he didn't. Sequences can automate a series of personalized emails and tasks based on recipient actions.

Navigate to the automation section, create a new sequence, and start linking your emails together like a pro. You set it, personalize it, and then let HubSpot do the nagging for you. Your lazy, forgetful side can thank me later.

## 3. **Lead Scoring**

Smooth operator Sally knew everything about her leads - their shoe size, probably. But she loved her lead scoring more. Using this feature, you can automatically grade your contacts based on their interactions, giving you a clear idea of who’s worth your time.

Configuring it is a breeze, simply set up criteria including email opens, link clicks, website visits, and assign point values. In a few days, you’ll have a lead list that’s sharper than a freshly minted razor.

## 4. **Content Strategy Tool**

Picture this: we're all huddled in the office kitchen on a chilly Monday morning, trying to crack the content slab for the quarter. Then Lisa, always the quiet genius, springs up with the Content Strategy Tool she’d pored over during the weekend.

It helps suggest content topics based on relevance and search volume. Create your topic cluster in the content strategy tool, plug in your focus topic and watch as HubSpot sprinkles magic by suggesting subtopics and linking them together. No more thankless brainstorming. Just another cup of coffee.

## 5. **Smart Content**

Darnell, our web design wizard, nearly hugged me when he discovered Smart Content - if you know Darnell, you know that’s a colossal thing. This feature allows you to tailor your content for different visitor segments.

Hop into your content editor, and select smart rules for your modules. Set the criteria like contact list membership or lifecycle stage. Your website will now display content that feels bespoke - as if you’ve peeked into the mind of each visitor.

## 6. **Email Health Tool**

Email marketing is a game of finesse. Karen, our email queen, lost sleep over open rates - bless her dedication. HubSpot’s Email Health Tool became her knight in shining armor.

Navigate to the reporting section and open the Email Health dashboard. You’ll see metrics that gauge sender reputation, engagement, and deliverability issues. Troubleshooting just got an upgrade - like switching from a candle to a flashlight in a blackout.

## 7. **Conversations Inbox**

Jake in customer service was always scrambling across platforms, trying to keep up with tickets, emails, and chats. Then came the Conversations Inbox - his savior.

This feature consolidates all your customer communications into one place. Set it up by connecting your communication channels to HubSpot's inbox and configure your response templates. Now, Jake could breathe and maybe even squeeze in a lunch break.

## 8. **HubSpot Keyboard Shortcuts**

Oh, shortcuts. The equivalent of taking the scenic route home. Megan, our efficiency enthusiast, stumbled upon HubSpot keyboard shortcuts and never looked back.

Simply press the “?” while in HubSpot to see the list of available shortcuts tailored for efficiency. Navigate like a magician - disappearing here, reappearing there - streamlining your workflow smoothly.

## 9. **Tasks with Queues**

Matthew, the manager of chaos, often felt overwhelmed until he discovered Tasks Queuing. This feature lets you organize tasks into prioritized buckets.

Inside your tasks tool, create a new queue, and assign tasks. You can move effortlessly from one task to the next, like Daniel LaRusso transitioning between Miyagi’s karate moves - punch, block, punch.

## 10. **Custom Report Builder**

Statistics always boggled my vivid imagination until Camille showed me Custom Report Builder. Imagine crafting reports so bespoke even bespoke feels tailored.

In your HubSpot dashboard, go to reports and select the custom report builder. Choose your data sources, filters, and visualization types. Camille now creates reports that tell a captivating story with every glance - who needs bedtime stories anymore?

We’ve laughed, we’ve cried (well, almost), and we've definitely grown wiser. It’s funny how tools we think we know can hold secrets, waiting to be uncovered. HubSpot isn’t just a platform—it’s a treasure chest begging to be plundered. Next time you find yourself wandering its digital halls, let curiosity lead the way. You never know what hidden features await to make your work life just a tad more delightful. Until then, stay curious, stay adventurous, and most importantly, don’t let those leftovers go to waste.
