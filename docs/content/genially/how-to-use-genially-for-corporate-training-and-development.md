# How to Use Genially for Corporate Training and Development

It was a Tuesday afternoon when my curious nature got the best of me. You know those moments when the world outside a window somehow looks more inviting than whatever is happening on your screen? That was me—and then some. I had been tasked with finding new methods for corporate training at our ever-evolving company, and, oh boy, did it feel daunting. A friend named Jamie, who always seemed one step ahead with this kind of tech-savvy wizardry, dragged me (virtually, of course) to give Genially a whirl. That subtle nudge turned into a delightful deep dive, and now here we are, ready to explore the magical landscape of Genially for corporate training and development.

### Discovering Genially: Our First Dive

Our first experience was akin to waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee on a lazy Sunday morning—invigorating and full of potential. We were sitting in—well, Zoom boxes—with curious faces peering in. As Jamie began sharing his screen, he told us about the essence of Genially, this wondrous online platform that turns bland presentations into interactive masterpieces.

#### Getting Started with Genially

First things first: let's sign up. Head over to Genially’s website. That moment when I clicked "Sign Up," a gentle sigh of relief passed—much like finally finding the right key to an old, stubborn lock. Enter your details or click ‘Continue with Google’ if you prefer. 

Once we were in, the platform met us with an interface as welcoming as an old friend—intuitive and vibrant, without being overwhelming. The dashboard caught our eye immediately, reminiscent of a digital playground begging to be explored. We felt a surge of giddy excitement, tinged with caffeine-like anticipation.

#### The First Creation: Breathing Life into Training Modules

"Let’s craft something magical," Jamie said, with a voice teeming with enthusiasm. We chose "Create Genially," the button that gleamed like a beacon. Imagine setting foot onto a blank canvas stretching to eternity, the possibilities limited only by your imagination.

1. **Select a Template:** A vast library unfolded before us, like stumbling onto a secret garden, each path leading to a different, vibrant world. We picked a template that screamed corporate chic—which I quite liked.

2. **Customize Your Heart Out:** Now, this step felt like decorating a birthday cake. We swapped images, juggled text, and played with colors. Each tweak and touch felt personal—perfect for tailoring that specific training module needed for our plot twist of a training session.

3. **Add Interactivity:** Here’s where Genially turns into a blockbuster film—ready to captivate and engage. We added clickable buttons, hover-over text for definitions, and even some video inserts because why not? Watching it come to life was like watching a child’s face light up upon seeing a Christmas tree sparkle and twinkle.

### Engaging Employees: The Magic of Interaction

Remember those monotonous training clips from yesteryear that made us nod off quicker than a warm cup of chamomile tea? Yeah, we do too. Genially, however, takes a machete to the boredom jungle of corporate training.

#### Keeping It Lively

The real win here was the ability to incorporate quizzes and feedback loops. Picture this: employees are not just passive viewers but active participants. Got a module on cybersecurity? Integrate a quiz right there. The platform offers real-time feedback, making it not just informative but fun—like learning but with a dash of mystery thrown in. 

### Collaborating as a Team

Here’s where Genially shines brighter than a lighthouse on a foggy night. Jamie joined me on a shared Genially project. It felt pretty much like summer camp for digital creators. With seamless collaboration, we added insights and made adjustments, all real-time. That’s team synergy, folks—like watching a band jam together, each member playing their tune in perfect harmony.

We even had a moment—remembering all those fragmented emails, broken attachments, lost edits—realizing that this platform allowed us to stay focused, organized, and ultimately happy. Genially made it as straightforward as sharing a pizza with friends, no squabbling about the last slice.

### Deployment and Feedback

After tinkering and tweaking until our hearts were content, we invited our colleagues to join in on the revelry. The platform allows sharing via links or embedding onto existing platforms. The feedback flowed in, which, quite honestly, felt like receiving a performance review from a wise old mentor.

#### Iterative Improvement

Seeing reactions—some ecstatic, some pointing out hiccups—was invaluable. Our training modules took on a life of their own, growing, morphing, much like watching a garden bloom. We didn’t just watch—it was an evolutionary process, and Genially was the catalyst.

### The Great Database Integration

Okay, time to get a bit techy—but bear with me, this is where your Sherlock Holmes magnifying glass comes out. For those of us harboring lofty dreams of data analytics and slick reports, integrating Genially with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) or databases is the key to kingdom wonderland.

#### The Integration Process

To accomplish this task:

1. **Select Your LMS:** Genially supports SCORM files, allowing us to dive into the deep end, integrating seamlessly. It's as simple as connecting the dots—well, almost.

2. **Export Your Module:** Within Genially, head over to ‘Export’ and choose SCORM format. Download it faster than a kid grabbing the last cookie from the jar.

3. **Upload to LMS:** Log into your LMS, navigate to ‘Upload SCORM file,’ and let the magic unfurl. 

Finally, we had a comprehensive, interactive module within our LMS, ready to unfold learnings to employees scattered across continents.

### Conclusion: Our Genially Journey

Revisiting that Tuesday, Jamie’s virtual exhortation was the spark to our burning blaze of change in corporate training. The varied palette of Genially allowed us to paint a masterpiece learning experience. We went on quite a journey—grabbing moments of joy and shared learning along the way, akin to a road trip with old friends, windows rolled down, laughter rolling out.

From onboarding to ongoing development, our corporate training now sparkled with vibrancy and engagement. And as we move forward, one thing remains crystal clear—Genially did not just aid in training; it became a companion on our path to discovery and growth. Here’s to more digital detours and collaborative adventures.
