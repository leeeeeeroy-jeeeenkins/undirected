# Tips for Making Your Genially Content Accessible to All Audiences

Once upon a time, nestled in the cozy confines of a bustling coffee shop, I found myself part of a huddle—a cross between a tech gaggle and a caffeine-fueled brainstorming sesh—figuring out a way to make someone named Emilie's project more accessible. Her Genially presentation was a visual treat but, alas, not everyone's cup of tea—not Emily's Aunt Margaret, or anyone else who found online content more perplexing than algebra on a Monday. This was our eureka moment. With wide-eyed determination and a shared sense of purpose, we dove headfirst into the world of accessibility. And learned. Oh, how we learned.

## Create a Logical Layout

Imagine Aunt Margaret: squinting at the screen, trying not to get lost in a tangled maze of content. We chuckled, just a bit, imagining her bewildered expression. But it got us thinking. **Structure matters.** Visualize it like hosting a dinner party—you wouldn't seat Uncle Bob next to the teen who just discovered death metal, right? Your Genially presentation should guide, not confound, its visitors. 

### Step 1: Organize Your Slides

Think about what's logical, like the steady pacing of a good novel, or how each sip follows the last of a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. Put things in order:
- **Start with an intro slide**—setting the scene, whetting the appetite.
- **Follow with the main content**, one bite at a time. Each slide should have a purpose, like each dish at our dinner party.
- **Wrap up with a conclusion**, leaving no stone unturned.

### Step 2: Consistent Design

We all hate betrayal, don’t we? Now imagine that betrayal comes in the form of mismatched fonts and colors. It's a design quagmire we vowed never to return to. Use Genially's themes effectively—stick to one or two fonts and a color palette that's easy on the eyes. We can't emphasize this enough—it’s like ensuring everyone at dinner gets a fork—vital.

## Alt Text for Images

Picture Meg—our friend who still uses a flip phone and isn’t ashamed—missing out on an adorable puppy meme because there were no descriptions. That was a somber moment. **Alt text is their gateway.**

Add descriptions for any image you include, ensuring everyone can understand your visual narrative. Genially makes this handy:
- **Click on an image, then 'Link & Actions'.**
- **Select 'Add alternative text' in the sidebar and fill in the text box.** 

Simple things like "a fluffy golden retriever pup basking in sunlight" make all the difference. Keep it short, sweet, and to the point. It should read like a tweet, not a novel.

## Clear and Concise Text

Once, during our caffeine adventures, we ran into Gertrude. She had crafted a presentation more verbose than a politician at an gala. We awoke to the beauty of being succinct. Your audience isn't here for a lengthy yarn; they're here for the meat and potatoes.

### Use Simple Language

Momma always said, "Keep it simple, sweetheart." And in content, that's sage advice. Skip the sesquipedalian vocabulary—we learned folks don't have time to Google every word. Say it straightforwardly.

- **Bad**: Expeditiously enhance your presentation.
- **Good**: Quickly improve your presentation.

### Headings and Subheadings Are Your Friends

Have you ever seen a book without chapter titles? Neither have we, and there's a reason for that. Headings break it down, turning a bulky wall of text into something manageable. Clearly define sections—another chance Aunt Margaret won't throw her hands up in frustration.

### Bullet Points Everywhere

We credit bullet points for salvaging Emilie’s presentation from obscurity. They make content skimmable, comprehensible. In Genially, select your text block and hit the bullet icon—ta-da, magic! 

## Ensure Keyboard Navigation

Keyboard warriors rejoice! Remember Jack, our teammate who shuns the mouse entirely on principle—and has the nimble fingers of a concert pianist? He taught us about the importance of keyboard navigation.

### Testing: Tab It Out

Set this simple rule—check your content by using just your keyboard. Yes, tab through every element:
- **Ensure all interactive elements are accessible.**
- **Links and buttons must light up like a Christmas tree when tabbed.**

## Testing with Screen Readers

This is where our story meets Tim—a visionary, blind yet boundless in his love for technology. His insight was invaluable. He showed us screen readers, turning invisible information into audible insights—an accessibility revelation.

### How to Test

Utilize Genially presentations with popular screen readers:
- **NVDA** (NonVisual Desktop Access)
- **Narrator** (built-in on Windows)
- **VoiceOver** (native on Mac)

Enter playback mode and listen. Is the content telling the same story audibly as it is visually? If not, there’s work to be done. Make adjustments on text structure, ensure labels are clear and informative, and watch your project transform.

## Adjusting Contrast and Colors

Jen, who taught art and saw color in ways that left us all inspired and slightly envious, pointed out something that seemed obvious only in hindsight. Not everyone sees color in the same spectrum. Amazing, right? **Contrast matters.** 

### Step 1: Check your Palette

Use tools like the WebAIM color contrast checker—thank you, Internet—to make sure your choices are accessible:
- **Ensure there's enough contrast between text and background.**
- **Consider those with color blindness—red and green are often indistinguishable.**

### Step 2: Universal Colors

Stick to high-contrasting colors for your text and background. When Jen once changed a vivid chart palette for something more 'kind to the eyes,' it not only looked better but became truly inclusive.

## Offer Downloadable Content

Recognize Anthony, a then-unknown poet who liked to annotate papers like it was an Olympic sport? His off-hand quip on keeping a physical piece led us to our final point. Some people prefer offline reading—or need it for accessibility applications.

### Providing Downloads

Genially generously allows downloadable PDFs:
- **Go to your 'Sharing Preferences'.**
- **Enable 'Allow download as PDF'.**

This small option opens doors to worlds we'd never considered.

Reflecting on our journey from coffee shop musings to accessibility gurus (self-proclaimed), we've become ardently aware of how small efforts can transform access for many. Aunt Margaret, Jack, Tim, Jen, and even Anthony—each had insights that, when added together, enriched our understanding and our presentations.

Incorporate these tips, talk to the Emilies seeking accessibility and simplicity in their Genially content, and let’s make the digital world just a bit more inclusive—one presentation at a time.
