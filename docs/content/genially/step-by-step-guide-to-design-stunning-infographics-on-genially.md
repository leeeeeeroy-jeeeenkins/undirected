# Step by Step Guide to Design Stunning Infographics on Genially

Once upon a time, or perhaps more accurately, last Tuesday, we found ourselves in the curious lull of afternoon coffee. You know the kind, where the caffeine is trying its best to outwit the inevitable dip in concentration. Our thoughts turned, as they sometimes whimsically do, to the vexing challenge of visuals — those tantalizing scenes painted not with oils on canvas, but with data on a screen. The moment reminded us, in a peculiar twist of serendipity, of that time when Jane from the marketing team strolled into the office, eyes alight with the feverish excitement that only a freshly-minted idea could spark. An infographic, she declared, wielding the term as if it was both wand and sword, that told our story in a single sweeping glance.

And so it began, an odyssey into the colorful, dynamic world of infographics on Genially — an odyssey we invite you to embark upon, cup of coffee in hand if you like.

## The Prelude: Logging into Genially

The first step is akin to embarking on a new adventure, where you gingerly insert the key into the lock, turning it to see what wonders lay hidden beyond the door. Head on over to the Genially website. If you don’t yet have an account, creating one is as simple as casually dropping a spoon into a mug. Fill in the details, a few clicks, and voilà — we have entered the realm!

As we logged in that fateful day, the anticipation was palpable, much like the swirling aroma of fresh espresso. We navigated through the vibrant interface, where every ineffable element seemed to beckon us toward creativity unfathomed.

## Step One: Selecting the Right Template

Here we were, amidst a plethora of templates, each waiting to cascade its tales of data in aesthetically pleasing fonts and hues. (Does anyone else picture a mad scientist in a lab of color wheels and pixel grids? Just us?) Jane was adamant — the template must spark like that one memorable fireworks display from last July. We sifted through themes, clicked on our chosen one, and began personalizing.

Simply navigate to “Create Genially” and select from presentations, gamification, or infographics. Admittedly, this might feel like choosing a favorite child, but worry not. The Preview function allows you to take them each for a test spin without ruffling any design feathers.

## Step Two: Crafting the Narrative

What’s an infographic without a tale to whisper between its charts and icons? Here, we began writing, weaving numbers and facts with the threads of our narrative. Jane was surprisingly adept at this — she had, after all, once achieved the impossible trifecta of storytelling, persuasion, and brevity.

This is where your personality can shine brighter than a full moon on a clear night. Your narrative should be compelling yet concise, like a haiku with tenacity. Tap double-click your text boxes to breathe your words into them. Tinker, tweak, and titillate until they whisper back the story you long to tell.

## Step Three: Colors and Typographies

Think of a painter standing before a blank canvas, palette in hand, with every shade in existence at their disposal. We delved into Genially's bounty of color palettes and typography options, experimenting like alchemists in pursuit of gold.

Jane picked a bold palette (no muted pastels for her) and a typeface with enough character to jump off the page and shake hands. Head over to the “Design” tab and prepare for a bounty of aesthetic choices — from radiant hues to fonts that could quite comfortably serve as your infographic’s spirit animal.

## Step Four: Adding Animation

Wouldn't it be delightful if your infographic danced a merry jig across the screen? In Genially, animation isn't just an add-on — it's a main event. We lingered by the “Animation” options like kids peering into a candy shop, eventually settling on effects that invigorated our visuals without overshadowing the story’s essence. Double-click on any element to animate its entrance, exit, or even its celebratory pirouette across the screen.

The animations transformed our infographic into a living, breathing entity. It was as if our data had donned tap shoes and broken into an exuberant number — Gene Kelly would have applauded.

## Step Five: Incorporating Interactive Elements

Momentarily, we paused to reflect on the power of interactivity; the ability to engage viewers, drawing them not merely as passive observers but as curious participants. Okay, perhaps adding a touch of interactivity is the modern equivalent of giving a story a plot twist worthy of Hitchcock.

With interactive hotspots — a kind of choose-your-own adventure woven within the infographic — viewers could delve deeper, unveiling layers of narrative hitherto concealed.

To do this, simply select the element you wish to hold a secret beneath its surface. Use the “Interactivity” button to add hidden gems — images, text, links — that reveal more of your tale at a click.

## Step Six: Fine Tuning and Prepping for Launch

The end beckoned, a strange mingling of anticipation and nostalgia. We savored our creation, scrutinizing every detail as one might admire a newly sprung blossom. Jane hovered over the “Preview” button, equal parts excitement and trepidation, but the result? A dazzling symphony of sight and story.

Fine-tune, adjust, and when satisfied, meander over to the “Share” or “Download” button. Our journey neared completion, yet the adventure was just beginning. Our infographic, much like Bilbo out into the world, was ready to tell its tale far and wide.

## The Curtain Call: Sharing and Learning

The final moment came that afternoon, as precious as the last kernel of popcorn, where Jane shared our newly minted infographic with the world (or at least the office email list). The response was palpable, a blend of awe and a few requests to “make another one for next week’s meeting?”

And thus ends our peculiar voyage into the realm of Genially infographics, but not without an echo of satisfaction that lingers, bringing us full circle to our afternoon musing and the joy of discovery. In crafting something beautiful, memorable, and above all, uniquely ours — wasn't that the story all along?
