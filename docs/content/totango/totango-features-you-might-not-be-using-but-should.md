# Totango Features You Might Not Be Using But Should

We've all been there, you know, staring at our computer screens, wondering why this fancy piece of technology feels more like an overcomplicated spaceship control panel than the Customer Success platform we signed up for. In my case, it was a Tuesday afternoon just after lunch – that post-sandwich lull – when I realized that Totango is just like that dusty novel on my bookshelf I've been ignoring for years. There's so much in it that I hadn't been tapping into. Let's journey together as we dust off the cover and dive into those hidden chapters, those underutilized features, the ones with the real magic.

## The Campaigns Corner You Never Visited

Back when I was still naive, I thought campaigns were just mass email blasts with a fancy name. It was Monica from Marketing who set me straight. Monica was this brilliant, no-nonsense woman who could find a silver lining in a rainstorm. She sat me down, latte in hand, and said, “Have you even tried the Totango Campaigns feature? It's like opening a treasure chest but for customer communication.” With her guidance, I discovered:

- **Segmented Targeting**: Create campaigns that speak directly to each customer segment – you know, like having a meaningful chat rather than shouting in a crowded room. Go to the Totango Segments tab, pick your group (like customers who've been inactive for a month), and boom! Instant connection.

- **Personalized Content**: It's like magic – insert variables such as names or recent activities in your messages so every customer feels like a VIP. Just add placeholders like `[[First Name]]` in your email templates.

- **Automated Journey Steps**: Why do all the legwork when campaigns can be scheduled? Set triggers based on actions (or the lack thereof) and let Totango hold the door for your customer communication, keeping it timely and relevant.

Monica's wisdom was transformative, and as I started to experiment with these tailored campaigns, I watched our engagement levels soar. It was like adding the right spice to the soup you didn't know needed it.

## SuccessBlocs: The Secret Sauce

Then came the revelation of SuccessBlocs. I remember Tim, our data guy with a penchant for quantum mechanics analogies, pop into a meeting exclaiming, “Why doesn't anyone use SuccessBlocs? It's like you've been given a Swiss Army knife and you’re just using it as a toothpick!” Indeed, these customizable blocks are full of:

- **Metrics that Matter**: Here, we can create dashboards that illuminate whatever we deem crucial. To set one up, head into Totango, open the SuccessBloc tab, then select 'Create a New Bloc.' Tailor it with your handpicked metrics!

- **Goal Tracking**: Define and track your journey through goals, moving from a 'Nice to Have' to a 'Need to Have.' Tim showed me how to set these up under each SuccessBloc, leading me to finally map progress rather than hope for it.

- **Playbooks**: Our marketing guru, Lisa, always said, “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.” Playbooks in SuccessBlocs are those plans. Design them under 'Actions' of a SuccessBloc to guide your team step-by-step through customer challenges.

SuccessBlocs turned into my favorite kitchen gadget – useful, powerful, and indispensable. Tim's analogy was so vivid that I started seeing possibilities everywhere.

## The Task Master That is Touchpoints

Let me take you back to a Monday morning when Frank, my boss with the demeanor of a hyperactive puppy, and I were discussing customer interactions. He asked, “How do we know what our latest interaction was with Client X?” There was silence. Crickets. Because none of us knew. That was when Totango's Touchpoints became our go-to:

- **Interaction Logs**: Touchpoints offered a roadmap of every engagement with customers. By logging every call or meeting within Totango, you build a storybook of your customer relationship.

- **Actionable Insights**: It’s a crystal ball for your team, showing what’s been done and what’s next. As Frank put it after we started using it, “It’s like having a personal assistant minus the awkward small talk.”

- **Automating Follow-ups**: Create recurring tasks for follow-ups so nothing slips through the cracks. You’ll find this under the Activity Stream on your dashboard – set it and forget it (until it kindly reminds you, of course).

Frank never had to deal with awkward silences again, and our customer interactions became much more coherent and streamlined, all thanks to Touchpoints.

## Celebrating with Zoe - The Conversational A.I.

Who would have thought that an AI could make you feel more human? I wasn’t a believer until Erica from Customer Support pulled me into her office, waved her hand like a magician, and introduced me to Zoe. Erica, always the first to embrace new tech, explained:

- **Instant Support**: Zoe dives into your data like a loyal hound on a scent, fetching answers to questions your team has without ever calling a meeting. Want quick metrics or updates? Just ask, and Zoe delivers.

- **Customer Compass**: Think of it like a northern star for your team. Zoe provides guidance based on latest customer data and trends, helping chart out the best path forward.

- **Influencing Quicker Decisions**: With Zoe feeding me info in real-time, I felt like those sci-fi heroes with a cool A.I. assistant. Just type your query into the Zoe chat interface in Totango, and watch as your productivity takes off.

Because of Erica’s foresight, noncommittal A.I. predictions became actionable insights, and our customer success strategy felt less like fortune-telling and more like science.

## Wrapping It All Up

It's funny to think back to all the features of Totango I wasn't using until these incredible people nudged, pushed, and cajoled me into the modern age. Each of these features, campaigns, SuccessBlocs, Touchpoints, and Zoe – they weren’t just tools; they were teammates. Leveraging them has been like opening different portals in the same universe, each leading to more cohesive, informed, and successful customer relations. 

We began seeing customer success as a dance, with each feature strengthening our rhythm like a well-behaved metronome. The melodies these rhythms conjure aren’t just pleasant; they’re vital for every business stage.

Let’s not allow incredible tools like Totango gather dust, akin to forgotten novels. Maybe you, dear reader, have your Monicas, Tims, Franks, and Ericas to help you discover these features. And if you don't, well, you've got us, just a meaningful read away.

Here's to getting more than we bargained for. Cheers!
