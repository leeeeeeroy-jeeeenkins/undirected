# Building a Customer Success Roadmap Using Totango

### A Journey Begins

Alright, folks—so there we were, Jean and I, two weary souls skulking through a bustling tech expo, caffeine-fueled and slightly lost on what our ragtag little startup needed next. We'd traversed the endless aisles of neon-lit booths, eager to find that missing piece for keeping our customers not just happy but absolutely thrilled. It was as if we were treasure hunters in search of the proverbial golden chalice. Then, amid the din of intensely caffeinated sales pitches, we stumbled upon a workshop promising to help us build a Customer Success Roadmap using something called Totango. Was it fate, serendipity, or just blind luck? Who knows.

Totango, they said, could help us actually _see_ the churn monster sneaking around our backyard, lurking behind the verdant bushes of customer data. A tool to help us conquer it and transform our customer relationships, not just into partnerships, but friendships. "Build a roadmap," they touted, and away we went, like Frodo and Sam, seeking our own Mount Doom, but a much friendlier and less fiery version.

### Understanding Your Customers

Jean scratched her head with an enthusiasm akin to solving a Sherlockian mystery while they introduced the first step: **Understanding Your Customers**. Imagine an ancient librarian meticulously categorizing scrolls of wisdom—similarly, we needed to segment our customer base. Totango had categories that felt like an astrological chart, ready for us to decipher. There was a lightbulb moment; like, these weren't just users—they were partners on a delightful journey through this virtual landscape we called our product.

We dove into this with Totango. Launch the platform and what do you see? You need to track your customers' usage patterns, understand their journey, and predict their needs like an uncanny psychic—but without the crystal ball. Totango wasn't about the basic demographics. Oh no, dear reader. We learned to track _engagement levels_, _feature adoption_, and even _support ticket frequency_! It was like learning every detail of what your new neighbor liked, right down to their preference of jam on toast.

#### Step into Totango's Shoes
- **Get Granular:** Segment your customers like you’re a chef choosing spices for every occasion. Dive into their activity history. Are they power users or newbies? Too much low adoption and perhaps a product update is in order.
- **Get Engaged:** Build a model of engagement—totally not a stalker-level detail, but merely attentive to their needs. Use data tiles and set up custom metrics. Thanks to Totango, we found some folks were only using one feature. Cue the virtual gasp!
- **Anticipate Needs:** Look to the future. Totango helps create success plays tailored to customer types. Customize a plan and wait for the magic.

### Crafting Your Roadmap

Crafting a roadmap, as we learned, isn't about drawing a linear path but about charting constellations, a cosmic guide for relationships. Jean and I realized we needed a canvas to pour our newfound knowledge onto, transforming raw data like raw ingredients into something delectable.

While everyone else was drooling over flashy tech gadgets and gizmos, our heads were lost in the clouds—specifically, Totango's successBLOCs (seriously, who comes up with these names?). They're ready-made templates brimming with rich features, as if infused with the essence of a thousand brainstorming sessions.

#### Steps to Charting the Constellation
- **Initiate with a successBLOC:** Why reinvent the wheel? Plan the uninstallation of free trials, upsells, or onboarding with ready-to-go templates.
- **Customize Your Galaxy:** Adjust the goals to align with your telescopic vision—where do you see your customers soaring off to? Tweak the campaigns to their sweet spots, adjusting touchpoints for maximum warmth and fuzziness.
- **Space for Growth:** Ensure constant iterations. As we gazed at our cuddly cat—asleep on an indigo couch—we realized that customer success is never static, always evolving like an infinite loop.

### Execution and Reflection

Right around this time, our journey got real. This wasn't just theory—we had actual folks waiting for our love letters of delight, hoping for a genuine connection. Imagine sending your mom newsletters—that's how personal it got. It was time to put our heartfelt talk into action and reflect on each step like we did when watching a movie the second time, catching all the banter we glossed over.

We began reaching out and engaging, small gestures first; from feedback requests to sharing success stories—like a symbiotic relationship between bees and flowers, each interaction fed into the next, fostering growth both ways.

#### Putting Your Plan in Motion
- **Follow Through:** Keep engagement fresh, like a lemon spritz on hot pasta. Schedule campaigns via Totango's orchestration features. Automate, personalize—delight.
- **Measure and Iterate:** Like keeping the finest of orchards, nurture your roadmap. Review dashboards for actionable insights and course-correct if a storm disrupts your sunny afternoon.
- **Celebrate Wins:** No-win ignored—small or big. Share them with your tribe and revel in the collective joy. Our small community felt more like family each time we shared their success—thank you, Totango.

### The Road Ahead

As our journey with Totango stretched further than our little booth experience initially hinted, Jean and I marveled at how customer success was less about the finish line and more about the constant dialogue. It's an opus in a never-ending symphony of trust and dedication, much like any good friendship.

We sat there, two tech enthusiasts, no longer lost, sipping coffee and bonding over the pages of our evolving roadmap. Building a Customer Success Roadmap using Totango was much like sculpting a masterpiece—each chisel left something smoother, each detail and texture adding to the story. A marvel we gladly share with you.
