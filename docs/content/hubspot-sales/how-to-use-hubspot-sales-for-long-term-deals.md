# How to Use HubSpot Sales for Long Term Deals

Picture this: a chaotic Monday morning, coffee in hand, when I realized our team was about to lose yet another long-term deal. Looking at our ragged spreadsheet that was supposed to be tracking leads, it suddenly resembled an abstract art piece rather than useful data. That's when I turned to HubSpot Sales. Spoiler alert: it changed everything. Let’s rediscover – together – how this tool can transform our approach to long-term business relationships.

## Navigating the Land of Deals

Remember when Nate from accounting tried using a Rolodex for client management? Yeah, that didn't go well. Fortunately, HubSpot Sales is the upgrade we need. First off, we need to get familiar with **Deals**. Think of them as our personal deal-tracking elves. Here's how:

1. **Creating a Deal**: Click on the 'Sales' drop-down, select 'Deals,' and hit 'Create deal.' Give it a name — something catchy yet professional, like "Mason & Sons Sky Yarn Initiative."

2. **Filling in Details**: Input the deal value, stage, and expected close date. This isn’t just data entry; wizardry happens later due to this info.

3. **Customizing Stages**: Tailor the pipeline stages to fit our business rhythm. Editing existing stages or adding new ones ensures every deal journey mirrors our unique process.

The deal dashboard now looks less like a jigsaw puzzle and more like a beautifully executed chess strategy.

## Embracing Automation (Not Skynet)

I'll confess, automation once sounded like something from a dystopian novel where robots take over. But hey, it’s really our silent partner. When we need to keep in touch — without the stress sweats — email sequences and task reminders are our digital saviors.

- **Email Sequences**: Set up automated emails for when prospects ghost us. It's not creepy if it's helpful; it’s just human-like persistence. Under Sales, head to 'Sequences' and draft a kind, engaging follow-up series.

- **Task Reminders**: Never miss a beat. Schedule tasks for yourself like reminding Jeff to check his emails or negotiate pricing next Thursday. Totally like sticky notes — just less sticky.

Our Monday mornings are now strategic instead of chaotic. It's like arriving on the battlefield early with snacks and coffee.

## Insights Galore

HubSpot has this mystical crystal ball called **Reports**. Once just something we'd ignore, they are now our wisdom source for data-driven strategies. Here's how our brains can tap in:

1. **Dashboards**: Create custom dashboards that provide snapshots of deal progress. Even Janet from marketing loves these — they're like memes she can actually use.

2. **Deal Forecasting**: Predict success with near-Mystic Meg accuracy. Dive into your data to forecast potential wins; it’s like having a time machine, minus any DeLoreans.

3. **Performance Reports**: Analyze completed deals, see which strategies worked, or gather data for a celebratory team pizza night.  

## Collaboration and Human Touch

Finally, beneath the layers of technology, it’s all about people. Remember the last team dinner debacle? It taught us that while HubSpot boosts efficiency, our humanity seals the deal. Share notes, keep everyone in the loop with @mentions, and always plan for an occasional human touch — like remembering birthdays or, you know, their names.

Now, through all these beautifully crafted processes, we’re not just closing deals; we're forging lifelong partnerships. Suddenly, closing long-term deals doesn’t seem like chasing shadows. Instead, it’s an exhilarating marathon we enjoy — together.
