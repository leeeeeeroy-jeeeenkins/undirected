# How to Create and Manage Deals in HubSpot Sales

Ah, the art of sealing the deal! Remember that time when we were trying to get the hang of HubSpot Sales, feeling like explorers without a map? It was Emily, our office's unofficial tech whisperer, who finally brought clarity. There's something enchanting about seeing a jumble of potential leads transform into organized, manageable data—like watching a mess of puzzle pieces click into place. Who would've thought managing deals could take on sparkles of magic amidst the digital grind? Let’s dive into how the wizardry happens.

## Setting Up Your First Deal: The Initial Rush

When stepping into the world of HubSpot for the first time, it's much like assembling IKEA furniture with vague instructions. We fumbled through the beginnings, laughing at our confusions—remember when we accidentally marked the CEO of our biggest potential client as "lost"? Oh, the panic.

1. **Access the Deals Tool**: First things first, let's navigate to the “Deals” section. It's right there in the dashboard, begging for attention. Click it, and we've opened the gateway to endless deal possibilities.

2. **Customize Your Pipelines**: Think of pipelines as our deal’s journey diary. We headed over to the “Settings” gear icon, clicked “Objects,” then “Deals.” From there, we customized the pipeline stages to match our unique process—Emily insisted on naming them after her favorite Harry Potter chapters.

3. **Create a New Deal**: By this stage, we felt like pros (or at least semi-pros). Click on the “Create Deal” button, fill in the blanks—deal name, amount, close date, yadda yadda. Be sure to select the proper pipeline Emily insists upon, else chaos reigns.

4. **Assign Contacts and Companies**: No deal is an island. It's vital to connect it with relevant contacts and companies. We’d link them by scrolling down—green arrows help in linking the deal with contacts. Sparse joy sprinkles!

## Managing Deals: Keeping the Plates Spinning

Now that our deals are sprouting like wildflowers, keeping track of them demands a delicate balance—think of it as juggling flaming torches while balancing on a high wire, but with less dramatics and more mouse clicks.

1. **Update Deal Stages**: As deals moved along (or tripped up) the pipeline, we’d update their stages by dragging and dropping them to the right spot. Easy peasy lemon squeezy, right?

2. **Track Activities and Progress**: HubSpot makes this quite the breeze. Log calls, emails, and notes under each deal, creating a breadcrumb trail of proof we can actually do things correctly. Every interaction logged adds to the story.

3. **Automate (Because Who Doesn't Love Robots?)**: Emily's favorite part—automations. Setting workflows that move deals along stages or trigger reminders meant less hand-holding and more high-fiving.

## Reflecting on Growth: The Sweet Tooth of Success

Looking back, managing deals became more than just a task. It was a testament to our glorious, bumbling teamwork. Emily turned out to be right—there's a joy hidden in turning chaos into order, akin to solving an enigma and feeling like a champion.

As we wrap this up, our tale of organizing chaos into orderly mini kingdoms in HubSpot hasn't just been functional—it’s been transformative. So go ahead, create, manage, and conquer these deals. After all, who needs magic wands when we have keyboards and Emily's wizardry?
