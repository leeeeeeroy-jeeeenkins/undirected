# Tracking Sales Performance Metrics in HubSpot

It was one of those seemingly ordinary Tuesday afternoons in December when it happened. The sun was doing its lazy winter thing, spilling through my office window just right, creating an atmosphere that screamed potential. I found myself sitting there, coffee in hand, pondering the enigma of sales performance. A question popped into my head—unprovoked and thrilling, like the first note of an unscripted jazz solo—"Are we really using HubSpot to its full potential?"

Funny how HubSpot felt more like an old friend than a software. We adopted it last spring, post our first sales cold spell. The software promised a vibrant universe of metrics and insights. Yet, staring at those insightful dashboards felt like deciphering a cryptic crossword puzzle. It’s a mix of bewilderment and excitement. An unsociable mix, if I might say.

## The Metrics We Tend to Overlook

In those first few months, our approach was straightforward—track what’s easy. We went after the low-hanging fruits: deals closed, revenue number. Naive, wasn’t it? Later came the realization—amidst a particularly challenging sales quarter—that not every delicious metric is served upfront.

Imagine opening HubSpot, like an old dusty tome of secrets, except it’s digital and less dusty. Over time, we embraced metrics such as **Deal Velocity** and **Lead Conversion Rate**. These, my friends, are your milestones—not just markers of success, but also beacons guiding future endeavors. Watching those metrics evolve was as thrilling as watching a caterpillar become a butterfly. Slow at first, then a complete metamorphosis.

But, I digress. Applying these metrics allowed us to unravel patterns we never knew existed. Suddenly, a story was being told, where before there was only silence.

## The Art of Personalizing Dashboards

Creating the perfect HubSpot dashboard became our little alchemy experiment. Remember when Alex—our head of sales, sporting his usual theatrical flair—dropped a new metric suggestion like a plot twist in a mystery novel? "Why not add time-on-website before contact?" he mused. And just like that, dashboards became personal. They weren’t just numbers but narratives tailored to our workflows.

### Here’s a delightful trick we learned:

1. **Access HubSpot Dashboards:** Navigate to Reports, then Dashboards. 
   
2. **Customize Widgets:** Click 'Add Report,' and choose a metric that aligns with your strategic direction—go on, indulge those creative whims.

3. **Analyze the Data:** Adjust time periods and sources. It’s a playground—make the swings go higher. Apply filters like you’re a barrista perfecting the perfect cup of brew.

4. **Savor the Insights:** What comes out of this exercise is akin to a plot resolution—patience brings clarity. 

This transformation of our dashboards was where the magic began to happen—personal connections through data, like having a candid chat with an old friend who knows you well.

## Our Key Takeaway

Most importantly, and what you've surely grasped is that HubSpot isn’t just a tool. It’s this unconventional ally reminding us that great sales performance isn’t merely checking boxes. It’s about curiosity and exploration. Every click, every metric unearthed, ignites a small flame of understanding in a vast dark room called sales.

As we sip our coffee, or maybe tea for those feeling a bit fancy, we reflect—what drives performance isn’t just numbers or software. It’s the stories we discover beyond the screens. Stories that show us who we are as salespeople, and who we can become. And dear reader, isn’t that really what makes this journey remarkable?
