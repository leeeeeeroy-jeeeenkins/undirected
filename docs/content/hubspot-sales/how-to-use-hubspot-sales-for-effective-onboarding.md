# How to Use HubSpot Sales for Effective Onboarding

Sitting at my cluttered desk, sipping lukewarm coffee that was definitely brewed a century ago, I remembered the chaos of my first week when we introduced HubSpot Sales into our onboarding process. There was an orchestral symphony of confusion and excitement, a cacophony of pings and notifications that made me feel like a captain trying to steer a spaceship through a meteor field. But oh, the magic when it clicked! Let’s journey through that story.

## The Chaos of First Impressions

Imagine walking into a room full of people, all speaking different languages, their voices mingling into an overwhelming din—this was the initial onboarding experience for some of our fresh recruits. I couldn’t help but feel like I was sentencing enthusiastic souls to a digital labyrinth. But once we discovered the beauty of using HubSpot Sales, it was as if we held the Rosetta Stone of onboarding. 

- First things first, create a custom onboarding template. We experimented with different structures—a bit of trial and error, like our office cat testing new napping spots—until we devised a 'welcome workflow' that spoke to the heart. It was simple: navigate to the 'Templates' section, click 'New Template,' and pour your undying love for your newbies into it.


1. Navigate to 'Sales Tools' in HubSpot.
2. Select 'Templates.'
3. Click 'Create new template.'
4. Add content that feels like a handshake and a welcome hug.


## A Symphony of Seamless Integrations

Oh, how integration saves us from the madness of app-hopping like an over-caffeinated rabbit—which we all inwardly hate but somehow end up doing daily. Remember our intern, Jeff, who managed to lose track of time just switching between tools? Not anymore. One of HubSpot's greatest gifts is its ability to integrate with tools we already use (and those we pretend we don’t).

- Set up integrations as if you’re arranging your favorite playlist—only the best tracks, no skips. By connecting apps like Gmail or Outlook, our onboarding became a seamless experience. A match made in productivity heaven. Our beloved bookkeeping app, Pierre (don’t ask why), effortlessly communicated with HubSpot, making Jeff’s life—and ours—a serenade instead of a cacophony.

## Tailoring The Journey: Custom Fields

Ah, the little personal touches—custom fields in HubSpot felt like leaving cookies and warm muffins at a new neighbor’s doorstep. We laughed thinking about the time we saved, and the mistakes we avoided, by designing our contact properties. It was like giving each new team member their own VIP backstage pass, complete with all the glitter.

- Creating custom fields is our digital handshake, ensuring each person feels acknowledged. Click on 'Add property' in the contact settings, decide what you need (maybe it’s a curiosity about their favorite dessert or niche hobbies), and watch as these tiny details transform onboarding into a red-carpet experience.

## Delight in Measurement and Feedback

Then there’s measurement—and no, we’re not talking about rulers or scales but assessing our onboarding brilliance. Without feedback, we’d be like a chef without taste buds—a tragedy. We utilized HubSpot’s reporting capabilities to continuously improve, crack open some cocoa, and chat about how we could inch a little closer to ‘peak onboarding brilliance’, if that’s even a thing.

- Run reports, analyze engagement, and gently laugh at our past mistakes. It's all in the 'Reports' tab, where you can create dashboards displaying the journey's peaks and valleys.

In the end, we found ourselves transformed and ready. HubSpot Sales was no longer a daunting presence in our tech stack but a trusted co-pilot on our rocket. Embrace the chaos, trust the system, and—most importantly—enjoy the ride. Now, where did I leave that coffee mug?
