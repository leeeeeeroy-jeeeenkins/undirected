# Advanced Tips for Using Ambassador API Effectively

Ever had one of those moments when the stars align and you unknowingly stumble across something brilliant? That was me, knees on carpet, hands resting on the keyboard, a day I rank among the good ones. A moment shared between a developer friend, Sarah, and her trusty dog, Milo, nestled in the corner like an old wise yogi. We embarked on a digital odyssey with the Ambassador API, unaware of the secrets it held. That moment! The coffee nearby simmering, steam rising as efficiently as our excitement.

Let me spill the beans, shall we? Here, within the folds of this article, we'll unravel the hidden potentials of the Ambassador API — dive into its depths with wild, unrestrained curiosity. We'll travel like wanderers sharing an ice cream just a lick away from brain-freeze knowledge. Hand in metaphorical hand, we'll discover how integration isn't merely coupling technology but knitting together ideas and dreams. Together, let's explore.

## Setting the Stage: The Initial Steps

Remember that small hiccup we faced when connecting the first service through Ambassador? It felt like a jigsaw piece not quite fitting. We needed the right angle, the right nudge. Begin, friends, by configuring your Ambassador to connect effortlessly with Kubernetes. 

1. **Install Ambassador**: Please don't skip this. With Kubernetes up, this step sets our pathway. Instructions are not some dusty folksy instructions: they’re the bones to this structure. Sarah and I, with our heads close together, ran:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-crds.yaml
    kubectl wait --for condition=established --timeout=90s crd -lproduct=aes
    ```

2. **Deploy Ambassador**: Our canvas! All creativity starts somewhere. Summon the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-rbac.yaml
    kubectl apply -f https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-service.yaml
    ```

3. **Verify the installation**: Look, there it is! Our beloved API Gateway running like Milo chasing a frisbee. Sneak a peek:

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc -n ambassador
    ```

Amidst the sprawling code, Sarah hummed a little tune. I thought it might just be missing lyrics—unwritten lines drafted by the tales of our budding API story.

## Crafting Custom Mappings

Now let's paint! The Ambassador API shines with customizable mappings. This mechanism lets us redirect traffic slickly, like anglers casting lines with elegance and purpose. “Imagine if we crafted these routes like stories,” Sarah suggested while doodling routes on the whiteboard.

1. **Create a Mapping**: For each service, create a file reflecting its story. For example, `backend_mapping.yaml` for directing traffic to `backend-svc`.

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
    kind: Mapping
    metadata:
      name: backend-mapping
      namespace: default
    spec:
      prefix: /backend/
      service: backend-svc
    ```

2. **Apply the Mapping**: Our symphony begins. Applying orchestrates the narrative.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f backend_mapping.yaml
    ```

3. **Verify**: With a hint of drama, ensure your story—er, mapping—is in place.

    ```bash
    kubectl get mappings
    ```

I recall Milo casually wandering between our desks at this point, sniffing out the scent of success. Here we were, sculpting routes to tenders of digital fate.

## Grasping Rate Limiting: Control and Responsibility

Power is intoxicating, but unchecked it can fizzle—or worse—ignite chaos. Rate limiting is the responsible friend's whisper when everyone else is shouting, “More!” Remember how we once let everyone in and… well, let's just say we learned about floods that day.

1. **Deploy Rate Limiter**: First, grant the power, deploy rate limiter component:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/rate-limit-service.yaml
    ```

2. **Define Policies**: Define how opulent or stringent you want to be. Write policies in YAML. For example:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
    kind: RateLimitService
    metadata:
      name: ambassador
      namespace: default
    spec:
      service: ratelimit
      timeout_ms: 2000
    ```

3. **Attach to Mappings**: Directly link these rules to mapped services:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
    kind: Mapping
    metadata:
      name: backend-mapping
      namespace: default
    spec:
      prefix: /backend/
      service: backend-svc
      rate_limits:
        - descriptor: open
    ```

The room had fallen silent. Even Milo seemed to nod in approval, acknowledging we were the gatekeepers, balancing flow and restriction.

## Embracing Authentication: Who Goes There?

We weren't done locking the door just yet. Authentication is like throwing a secret password party: only those in the know get in. Do you remember how we set up our first rule? It was like magic, watching unauthorized visitors bounce away like rubber balls.

1. **Configure External Authentication**: Set up authentication with an intercepting service.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
    kind: AuthService
    metadata:
      name: basic-auth
      namespace: default
    spec:
      auth_service: "auth-service"
      path_prefix: "/extauth"
    ```

2. **Attach to Mapping**: Include the authentication check in your service route.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
    kind: Mapping
    metadata:
      name: secure-backend-mapping
      namespace: default
    spec:
      prefix: /secure-backend/
      service: backend-svc
      ambassador_id: basic-auth
    ```

In our minds, we pictured each unauthorized attempt thwarted, users turning away, almost bewildered. Meanwhile, Sarah's laughter echoed in the room, "Another challenge hurdled!"

## Monitoring and Observability: The Watchful Eye

We couldn't close our tale without thanking our all-seeing eyes. Monitoring and observability ties everything together, making sure no mistake goes unnoticed, no success uncelebrated. Sarah and I, with mugs in hand, watched the dashboards illuminate our screens—proof of our journey.

1. **Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana**: Install your choice of observability tools.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://path/to/prometheus/operator/manifests
    kubectl apply -f https://path/to/grafana/manifests
    ```

2. **Leverage Metrics**: Arm yourself with metrics that empower. Ambassador exposes detailed metrics; feed them to Prometheus without hesitation.

    ```yaml
    scraping_configs:
    - job_name: 'ambassador'
      kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: end_point
    ```

3. **Dashboards Galore**: Console yourself before dashboards that narrate stories. Configure dashboards and alerts.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: grafana
    spec:
      ...
      env:
      - name: GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD
        valueFrom: ...
    ```

It's in these flickering lights and graphs that our journey comes full circle. Milo, touched by the same magic, yawned contently in his little corner—a reminder of the cozy bond tech fosters between us all.

## Conclusion

And then, dear friends, we find ourselves here. Acing Kubernetes Ambassador like an unassuming victor at a small local fair; it's not the grandeur, but the camaraderie that counts. We ventured out, no grand destination in mind, just curiosity at our heels, finding ourselves champions of a crafted digital realm.

Let's remember those fleeting yet profound Minnesotan afternoons, enriched by hot cocoa and endless possibilities. Through trial and triumph, our shared discoveries printed their kaleidoscopic narratives—a combined effort made richer with Sarah’s thoughts, Milo’s presence and I as narrators. Unveil, explore, and forever learn. That's the beauty inherent within our evolving dance with the Ambassador API.

Take this destination-less journey and forge futures painted with the colors of experience, fraught with the emotions and connections we all cherish. Until next we meet, may you find joy in your explorations, like a handful of stars pocketed from the sky.
