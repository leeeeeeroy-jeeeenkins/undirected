# How to Collaborate with Teams on Canva Projects

A few months ago, I found myself at a quaint café sipping an overpriced though irresistibly aromatic macchiato. My friend Lucy sat across from me, frantically gesturing at her laptop. "Canva," she said, sprinkling the word with equal parts exasperation and hope, "Our team project deadline is looming, and we need all hands on deck." It was like pulling funny faces through Plexiglas: we could see the potential but couldn't quite grasp it. Ah, the relatable quaintness of digital collaboration—almost an oxymoron at times, isn't it? But as we clicked around in the whimsical yet bustling town called Canva, we were about to embark on a journey that would not only demystify this platform but bring a sprinkle of joy to our creative process. 

## Setting Up Your Team Space

Think of it as hosting a dinner party. Only here, the appetizers are your thumbnails. We started by creating a team space on Canva, which, unlike the real world scenario of squeezing in extra chairs, is ridiculously easy. You navigate to the "Your Teams" sidebar, click "Create a Team," and voilà—you're sending invites to your creative comrades faster than you can say "pass the bruschetta." When Lucy and I set up our virtual haven, it felt like setting up a cozy tent full of potential.

## Assigning Roles and Permissions

Now, onto the fun yet slightly chaotic bit of determining who gets to do what. This isn’t musical chairs, but we insist you meet Tom. Tom, who had a penchant for turning simplistic designs into Jackson Pollock-esque marvels, needed a bit of restraint—hence "Comment Only" permissions. Choosing roles can make or break a project’s harmony, much like selecting the right playlist can. It prevents disasters, like when my younger brother discovered the world of glue guns. To assign these roles, simply navigate to "Manage Team," select your cohort, and hover as if you're about to pounce. Choose wisely, like selecting toppings on a pizza: too many, and it's chaos.

## Collaborating in Real Time

Ah, the pièce de résistance: the thrill of watching cursors dance across a shared canvas like fireflies on a humid summer night. We watched, mesmerized, as Lucy seamlessly added a shade of turquoise that mimicked the ocean’s allure right before someone else typed in their ideas. Luckily, Canva’s real-time collaboration is akin to a well-orchestrated symphony. Unlike those awkward Zoom calls where we all try not to talk over each other, here, conversations flow more like a well-conducted orchestra, harmonious and crisp.

## Feedback and Iteration

Feedback is crucial, though it can feel like walking on eggshells. Lucy’s gentle critiques were our lighthouse in a swirling sea. Through the comments feature — click on the bubble icon, it’s that simple — you can place a digital post-it directly on the design. Just like spilling the tea, but constructive and glamorous. Although Lucy once left a comment riddled with emojis, our team gleaned her message well.

## Wrapping Up and Sharing

Finally, the moment we relish: sharing our masterpiece with the world—or at least our manager. We clicked "Share," chose the right people, and submitted a project that felt seasoned with teamwork. It’s like releasing a dandelion into the wind. You can also export in sunbeam-skirting formats like PDF, PNG, and JPEG, catering to any preference your audience might whimsically demand. 

As we packed our bags in the café, Lucy turned to me with a grin, “That was surprisingly...fun.” And isn't that what collaboration should always be—a spirited dance of creativity, conversations peppered with laughter, and designs echoing joyful intent? So, fellow creators, may your Canva collaborations always be like Lucy's infectious laugh: genuine, unexpected, and wonderfully contagious.
