# How to Design a Custom Planner in Canva

Do you remember that time when Marie Kondo told us to spark joy, and most of us ended up with closets full of empty hangers and a teetering pile of things we couldn't bear to part with? I certainly do. At least, in the whirlwind aftermath of tidying my home, I found solace in the promise of organizational peace. Enter the world of planners. Not those boring, cookie-cutter types, but the kind we make our own. The glorious, sticker-filled planners that hold all our important dates and spontaneous musings. The problem? None were exactly right. Until I discovered Canva.

## The Spark of an Idea

We’ve all felt it, that itch for uniqueness and control over our lives—imagine designing a planner that caters to every little whim of our whimsical days. As I stumbled through Canva for the first time, I couldn’t help but feel like a kid in a candy store. There’s something gleefully rebellious about choosing, oh I don’t know, purple llamas and starry backgrounds because, why not?

### Step 1: Setting the Stage

First things first: Canva is our blank canvas. We log in or create an account—basic stuff, like finding the TV remote. From the homepage, let’s hunt down "Create a Design." We punch in "Planner," and presto, we’re faced with choices galore. Here’s a tip: Take a deep breath and embrace the rollercoaster ride of possibilities.

### Step 2: Themes and the Great Aesthetic Debate

It was Nathalie, a dear college roommate, who once said, “No aesthetic, no life.” And as quirky as that sounded, it sort of stuck. Choosing a theme is like picking the right bathrobe—cozy and reflecting who we are. Dive into Canva’s pre-made templates or start stark. We select colors, fonts, and vibes. You want an oceanic serenity? Got it. Retro madness? Ditto. Drag, drop, and don’t hold back.

### Step 3: Time to Personalize

Remember how Steve always annotated his textbooks with post-it notes and eccentric doodles? Embrace that inner Steve. Use Canva’s text and element tools to tweak everything. Add our name proudly at the top, maybe an inspiring quote that isn’t too Hallmark. Let’s place in birthday reminders, quirky holidays like "National Unicorn Day"—just because it’s fun, and yes, real.

### Step 4: The Fun Bells and Whistles

We sprinkle in the extras like memories peppered with laughter. Videos tabs, habit trackers, stickers—Canva is like Mary Poppins' handbag. And just when we think it’s done, the darling of decorative doodads catches our eye: grids, emojis, shapes that defy logical usefulness but bring a smile. Who knew organizing could be this delightful?

### Step 5: A Print and a Promise

Satisfied with our masterpiece, it's time to decide how to execute it in the real world. Export it, maybe as a PDF. Print it at home, or on ultra-stunning premium paper the way Heather would have—because we are just a bit lavish when it comes to self-investment. And promise ourselves to cherish, not overwhelm.

## The Journey Continues

In the end, our custom planner is more than a set of dates and tasks; it’s a story of creativity and control, dotted with doodles and dreams. As we flip through this creation, let's remember it's okay to have a bit of chaos amidst the organization—just like our lives. So, grab those colored pens and get planning. After all, life’s too short for black-and-white schedules.
