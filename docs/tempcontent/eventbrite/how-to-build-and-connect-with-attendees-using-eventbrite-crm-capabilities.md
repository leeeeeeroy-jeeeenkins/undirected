# How to Build and Connect with Attendees Using Eventbrite CRM Capabilities

If I had a dime for every time I attended an event and thought about how I could've connected better with the people around me, well, I'd have... a couple of dollars at least. Imagine this: we're at a bustling tech conference, juggling multiple apps to track who's who, scribbling notes on their interests—only to lose them in the chaos of free tote bags and coffee spills. Sound familiar? This was exactly what happened to us at TechFest '22. 

Enter Eventbrite’s CRM capabilities, our newfound ally in turning event chaos into meaningful connections. It's not just about tracking, but nurturing relationships, and we’re here to share how we turned our conference nightmares into dreams full of potential.

## Setting Up for Success

Picture this—it's like prepping for a blind date, only with a room full of strangers who could become your next big collaborator. Before diving into the event, the key step is preparation via the Eventbrite dashboard. First things first: creating an event. We realized that setting up the basic details on Eventbrite was akin to writing the opening lines of a heartfelt letter.

Simply navigate to your Eventbrite account, click on **Create Event**, and fill in the essentials like date, time, and description. Seems straightforward, right? It is! Just ensure your description says, "Hey, come here—and you're going to love it." Once that’s done, delve into the "Manage Attendees" section—our digital "little black book" of event networking.

## The Magic of Attendee Insights

One of our fondest memories from an event involves a surprise encounter with Sasha, an AI enthusiast we met by chance. Prior to Eventbrite CRM, such serendipitous meetings remained just that—chance encounters. But not anymore.

Imagine having detailed insights about attendees (not in a sinister way, of course, promise) before the event. Go to the "Attendee List"—your compass in a sea of endless networking opportunities. With Eventbrite's features, you can see who’s coming and what they’re interested in. This transforms how you approach them—like Oscar, the elusive web developer you’d been wanting to meet, only now, armed with context about his recent projects, you're confident, ready with conversation starters that matter.

## Building Genuine Connections

Connecting with attendees through Eventbrite CRM feels like playing matchmaker with fate. Instead of relying on sporadic chitchat, dig deeper. We found injecting a tinge of personalized communication through pre-event emails not only breaks the ice but makes conversations at the event bloom like a well-nurtured plant.

From the Eventbrite dashboard, accessing tools to send specific messages to attendees strategically before they arrive tightens that bond. What we found most impactful was personalizing these communications—you know, a little splash of humanity and humor mixed with genuine curiosity about attendees' interests. Our reunion with Sasha at the next year's event? Turns out, it was because of one such email—she loved our pun about AI!

## Reflecting and Growing

Post-event reflections were our gold mine for limitless potential. Angela, one of our event regulars, remarked that using Eventbrite's analytics—we were able to pinpoint our triumphs and flounders. In the murky aftermath of events, go to **Reports** to gather insights from your event. Who showed up? What sessions were most popular?

Herein lies the joy of discovering what resonated with attendees—allowing us to build better, more impactful events. And trust me, when you see the big picture from these reports, it's like watching a plot twist in your favorite series and realizing everything makes complete sense.

In the end, using Eventbrite CRM transformed our approach to events. It was like finding the right tool that not only smooths the path toward new connections but enriches our interactions—as if every newfound relationship was a page turning in this ever-evolving storybook of collaboration and inspiration. Cheers to many more shared human moments and optimized overlays of smiles and handshakes.
