# How to Curate a Sustainable and Green Event Using Eventbrite Features

Years ago, there we were, Karen and I, planning our first event—a baby shower for a friend who was as green as they come. We were knee-deep in eco-friendly bunting and pulling our hair out trying to make it all sustainable. You know, that frantic dance between wanting everything to be perfect and, oh yes, saving the planet in the process. That day taught us a couple of lessons: One, always choose eco-friendly balloons—biodegradable, if you must—and two, Eventbrite can be your best ally in organizing a fabulous, planet-loving event. Trust me, I've lived through it. 

## Crafting that Green Theme

We'd learned our lesson, and moving forward, it was all about making sustainability the star of the show. First thing's first, Eventbrite’s platform is easy. Seriously. From the event type down to the crisp details about what makes your event environmentally adorable, it's all there. You can highlight the use of compostable materials or vegan food— Karen never stops raving about that one time she had chickpea sliders at an event; it’s become the stuff of legend. Use your event page to spell it out: Sustainable. Vegan. Zero Waste.

As you set up your page, consider adding a splash of creativity that might hint at the sustainable delights awaiting attendees. Less copy-pasting, more crafting a narrative. It's like sautéing garlic; subtle but sensational.

## How to Skip the Waste

Paper invites? Nope. Passé. We opted for digital RSVPs and what a game-changer. It's like magic—or at least what Merlin would do today. Eventbrite's online tools to collect RSVPs not only saved trees but also our sanity. We were sending invites faster than you could say “carbon footprint." 

Plus, there's this neat feature for online ticketing. You ever watch those movies where the character waltzes through a crowd without a single hitch? That's you now, with electronic ticketing. People just scan and go, effortless like a Sunday morning. No need for printed tickets to litter your perfectly green event.

## Engaging the Eco-warriors

Here's the thing: Every event is a little revolution in itself. When we planned that baby shower redux, we wanted to build a community, not just host a meet-and-eat. Through Eventbrite, we tapped into social media cycles—mostly by accident at first but hey, it worked—to engage the eco-warriors in our circles. 

You can use interactive features to ask questions or request input before the event—helps start conversations. Include something unexpected to create buzz, like “Which locally-sourced ingredient should be our main dish? Vote!”

Then there’s the joy of analytics—because let's face it, staring wide-eyed at charts that suggest you're a sustainability God or Goddess is incredibly rewarding. Track engagement rates or how many people actually read the green tips you bundled with the invites. Data never lies, and it loves being pored over.

## Post-Event: The Green Encore

Wrapping things up doesn’t just mean recycling the empty bottles. We realized follow-ups are vital. Post-event feedback was another flawless Eventbrite feature. Thank people for attending, but slyly ask for critiques (What? It’s free advice). Donate proceeds—that’s if you charged—and announce it; it’s good to give and even better to let people know. 

Did everyone love Karen’s legendary chickpea sliders? Offer them the recipe—digital, of course. And suddenly, there’s a collective sense of community continuing beyond the Smith’s compost heap.

In that event, Karen and I became more than just planners. We were contributors to a green cause, hosts of a cohesive experience, and curators of memories that inspired a few giggles and, most importantly, lots of recycling. So, let’s raise our biodegradable glasses—to one event at a time in this marvelous blue and green world. Cheers!
