# How To Segment Contacts In HubSpot

It was a sweltering Tuesday afternoon in June when Michelle, our marketing dynamo, popped into my corner of the open office, her eyes sparkling with excitement despite the incessant heat. "Tom, can you help me segment our contacts in HubSpot?" she asked, juggling a notepad and a cold brew coffee like a seasoned circus performer. Her question was so casual, yet it felt like the universe was nudging us toward a tech-adventure.

## The Beginning of Understanding

In the labyrinth of HubSpot, segmentation can seem like a beast with many heads. But believe me, it's more like a friendly dragon offering you treasure once you get to know it. Michelle and I dove headfirst into the task.

First off, we logged into our account - me muttering passwords under my breath like incantations. From the dashboard, we clicked on "Contacts" in the top menu. There it was... the gold mine, the heartland: **Lists**. We clicked on "Lists," revealing a world of possibilities.

**Step 1: Create a New List**  
Navigating to the upper right corner, a bright orange button beckoned: "Create List." Michelle hit it with the flair of someone starting a crucial countdown. We were prompted to choose between a `Static list` and an `Active list`.

- *Static lists* are like snapshots; they capture contacts as they are at the moment.
- *Active lists* are fluid, dynamic, ever-changing with conditions ensuing.

We chose "Active list" because it felt like choosing the right tide to sail on. We named it "Engaged Contacts," because clarity matters. Names are spells, and this one was meant to transform our approach.

## Diving Deeper Into Filters

"This part is like sifting through a treasure chest," Michelle mused. We clicked "Next" to enter filter territory. Filters in HubSpot, folks, are the secret sauce. They're like the spices in a good curry—too few and it's bland; too many and you've overdone it.

**Step 2: Add Filters**  
First filter on our list: Contact properties. We chose "Lifecycle Stage" and set it to "Customer" because, duh, they’re who we want to engage. Next, we added Email Activity filters to zero in on contacts who had opened emails in the past 30 days. Quick tip: Email Activity grows stale, just like bread—keep it fresh!

**Step 3: Hit That Save Button**  
Once our filters were set, the final step was to hit "Save." It feels mundane, like the end of a long hike when you just want to sit down. But hitting that save button is magic; it organizes our treasure trove of contact data into something meaningful.

## The Joy of Segmentation

"Tom, look at this!" Michelle exclaimed, a broad smile stretching across her face. She showed me the mobile app, where our newly created lists were already showing fantastic engagement rates. "Now we know who really reads our emails," she said, sipping her cold brew triumphantly. We felt like codebreakers, uncovering hidden truths.

Segmenting contacts in HubSpot isn't just a task; it's a journey of discovery. Each list you create peels back another layer, revealing a clearer understanding of who our customers are and how we can better connect with them. It's exhilarating—like finding your way through a maze and discovering a hidden garden in the center.

To all the Michelles and Toms out there—get excited about segmentation. Make it an adventure. Because, in the end, it's not just about numbers and filters. It's about understanding people. And that's the real treasure.
