# How To Use HubSpot For Competitive Analysis

You know that moment when you’re sitting with a cup of coffee, halfway through making a Game of Thrones analogy, and someone drops a truth bomb that changes your outlook completely? Yeah, so I was deep in a strategy session with Sara, our resident marketing guru. We were dissecting metrics, theories flying around like confetti, and my half-baked data from HubSpot. That’s when Sara leaned in, eyes twinkling with conviction, and said, "Ever tried using HubSpot for competitive analysis?"

## The Day Sara Became a Prophet

So there we were, in our tiny, purposefully cluttered office space, when she logged into HubSpot and began to unravel the sorcery. She clicked, prodded, and before I knew it, I was clutching my coffee like it was a holy relic. HubSpot wasn’t just for our metrics. It was our window into the very souls of our competitors. I’ll untangle those steps for you here.

### Step 1: Setting Up Competitors

First things first, log into your HubSpot account. You’ll find the ‘Competitors’ tool under the ‘Marketing’ tab. Simple? Absolutely. Yet, staring at it felt like standing at the gates of Mordor, but friendlier. We added our main competitors—all five of them—by clicking the little 'Add Competitor' button. Enter their domains, hit save, and voila. HubSpot starts working its magic.

I remember Sara adding her favorite nemesis, Acme Corp. “Finally,” she muttered. “Let’s see what they’re really made of.” The look on her face? Picture a kid on Christmas morning, except the gift was market domination.

### Step 2: Digging Into Metrics

The dashboard populated, and I nearly spilled my coffee. Metrics like Alexa Rank and Moz Domain Authority stared back at us. Essentially, these are your golden tickets to understanding online visibility. HubSpot also shows social media following and blog analytics. As Sara said, “It’s as if Santa went full-on data nerd."

We spent hours comparing our stats to theirs. The trick? Focus on trends, not one-off numbers. If their Alexa Rank dives, it’s a signal. Mayday, all hands on deck. But a one-week dip? Maybe someone tripped over their own SEO strategy.

### Step 3: Content Analysis

The beauty of HubSpot doesn’t just end with raw numbers. Dive deeper into their content strategy. Under the ‘Content Strategy’ section, you’ll find information about their top-performing content. Sara’s eyes widened with joy when she discovered Acme’s most shared blog posts. “We can do better than that," she said, grinning like a Cheshire cat.

We took notes on content themes, frequency, and engagement. HubSpot even shows backlinks, giving us a map of their digital influence.

### Step 4: Social Media Monitoring

Next stop: social media. HubSpot pulls in data across platforms. We looked for spikes in engagement—like that time Jim from Acme tweeted something outrageous and caught viral fire. We used this info not just to keep tabs, but to craft our own strategy. 

Remember the “Ice Bucket Challenge”? It was a phenomenon. HubSpot helps you spot those potential waves within your niche. Ride them or create your own. Either works.

### Step 5: Regular Check-Ins

The competitive landscape changes faster than Bill Gates can say “antitrust.” Regular check-ins are essential. Set a rhythm—monthly, bi-weekly, whatever keeps you alert yet sane. Use HubSpot’s alerts to get notified when significant changes occur. “Like feeding our competitive side without the calories,” Sara cooed.

## Epilogue Of Discovery

So, there you have it. Sara’s epiphany turned our HubSpot usage from pedestrian to profound. We learned to use it as a competitive periscope, peering into the rival waters not just to float but to sail ahead.

HubSpot’s more than a tool. It’s our competitive edge. Our secret weapon. With a bit of curiosity, a splash of Sara’s moxie, and perhaps a touch of coffee-induced inspiration, you too can transform your approach to competition—one click at a time.
