# How to Use Pipedrive for Follow Up Management

You know that feeling when you’ve just had the most promising meeting of your life, like, Helen from marketing was so impressed she almost spilt her overpriced kombucha? And then you blink, and three weeks have passed with nary a word from her. Yeah, I’ve been there too. The trick to avoid that abyss we call forgotten follow-ups is having a handy tool like Pipedrive.

## The Moment of Enlightenment

Let me take you back to a little Tuesday three years ago when I couldn’t keep track of my leads if my life depended on it. I was running around like a headless chicken after every client meeting, jotting notes on scraps of paper that inevitably found their way into the black hole known as my car’s glove compartment. That’s when Stacey, our operations wizard (seriously, she has a Harry Potter wand on her desk), grabbed me by the metaphorical shoulders and introduced me to Pipedrive.

### Getting Started with Pipedrive

Picture this: It's like Stacey handed me a sat-nav for my follow-up jungle. The first thing we did was **set up Pipedrive**. You need to get the basics right, folks. Go to [Pipedrive's website](https://pipedrive.com) and sign up for an account. They ask for the usual suspects: name, email, and password. Once you’re in, configure your company’s settings – it’s like filling out an online dating profile but for your business.

#### Customizing Your Pipeline

You ever try to follow someone else’s grocery list? Chaos. Pure chaos. That’s why we customized our pipeline. Inside Pipedrive, click on the “Pipeline” tab. Add stages relevant to your business process. Ours went something like: Contact Made, Meeting Scheduled, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, and Closed Deal. Each stage a tiny victory, a small badge of productivity.

#### Inputting Leads and Contacts

Remember the time when Brian, our sales expert, forgot to follow up with that million-dollar lead and almost got a collective facepalm from the team? Not anymore. Input all your contacts manually or import them via CSV files. Pipedrive walks you through this like a friendly tech butler – click "Add Lead," fill in the details, hit save. Voila!

### Scheduling Follow-Ups

Uncle Ben said, “With great power comes great responsibility,” but I think he was also talking about follow-ups. Here’s where Pipedrive shines like Stacey’s holographic stickers. Schedule your follow-ups directly within the interface. Each deal, each contact, cries out for attention. Click on a contact, select "Schedule Activity," choose your method – call, email, or meeting. Pipedrive even suggests the best time to reach out, so you don’t end up calling someone at 7 AM, like I did once. Oops.

### Keeping Track and Staying Organized

Sure, you can have the best intentions, but what’s key is tracking progress. Helen – remember Helen? – she became a client because I stayed on top of everything. Pipedrive’s timeline view shows a visual representation of where each deal stands. It’s like having a whiteboard that updates itself. Use the dashboard for an overview – it’s pretty postcards from the land of your accomplishments.

### Automations and Efficiency

Brian’s a big fan of doing things the easy way. With Pipedrive, you can automate repetitive tasks. Go to the “Power-Up” tab and set automations like sending thank-you emails post-meeting or reminders for follow-ups. It’s almost like having a personal assistant but without the guilt of forgetting their birthday.

### Closing the Deal

The sweetest moment of them all is seeing that status change to "Closed Deal." It’s like a high-five from the universe. Helen sent over the contract, and our team practically threw confetti – okay, it was just paper shreds from the office shredder, but it was still epic.

## Wrapping It Up

Pipedrive transformed our chaotic follow-up mess into a streamlined, efficient machine. It's like going from driving an old beat-up car to cruising in a sleek sports vehicle. You, too, can conquer the follow-up jungle. Imagine all the Helens just waiting for your call. Don’t be like old me, drowning in sticky notes and missed opportunities. Take the plunge, and let Pipedrive be your guide.

Here's to not letting any Helens slip through the cracks. Cheers to Stacey for saving the day and to us for making it count.
