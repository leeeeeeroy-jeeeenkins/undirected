# How to Set Sales Targets in Pipedrive

It was the crack of dawn—birds chirping, coffee brewing, the works. Jane, my go-to partner in everything sales-centric at Hyperdrive Inc., and I were in the trenches, mired in spreadsheets and pivot tables. You know, the kind of stuff that sucks your soul but also holds the key to our next quarterly bonus. That morning, our mission was clear: set ambitious yet achievable sales targets in Pipedrive. Easier said than done, right? 

## The Spreadsheet Abyss

Remember that feeling when you’ve been staring at a spreadsheet too long, and suddenly cells begin to morph into an alien language? That was us, Jane and I, on a typical Wednesday. “There’s got to be a better way,” she sighed, sipping her third cup of coffee, now cold. Ah, Pipedrive to the rescue—our digital knight in shining armor.

Despite its intimidating first look—so many buttons, so many possibilities—Pipedrive can be a streamlined oasis of clarity. Setting our sales targets became our morning’s coffee-fueled challenge, and we were ready to crush it. 

### Step 1: Navigate to Goals

In the midst of our caffeine-induced haze, we remembered that getting started was just a click away. Log into Pipedrive. On the sidebar, find the ‘Progress’ tab. Hover over it. See that ‘Goals’ option? Click it with the excitement of a kid opening a birthday present.

Golden rule: knowing where to find your tools is half the battle. Imagine if we had to find a screwdriver, but couldn’t even tell where our toolbox was. That’s how essential this first step is. Make friends with the sidebar.

### Step 2: Create Your Goal

Once we were in the ‘Goals’ section, it felt like discovering hidden treasure. “Alright, let's do this!” I said louder than necessary. Jane chuckled, but joined in with her mouse clicks. Click on ‘+ Add new goal.’ An innocent-looking pop-up emerged. 

Here’s where things get real. Name your goal—something that screams ambition. Next, choose the goal type. Is it revenue? Is it deals? For us, it was a heady cocktail of both, but you do you. Set the target value—don’t be stingy but keep it doable. Specify the timeframe. Believe me, deadlines are your best frenemies.

### Step 3: Assign the Goal

We encountered a slight hiccup here. Oversight on our part. When assigning the goal, don’t make it Jane-and-I-against-the-world scenario. Use the ‘Assigned to’ field to involve other team members. Think of it as sharing the load, like how Jane graciously shares the snack stash at her desk.

### Step 4: Monitor and Adjust

Alright, goals set—bam! Don’t wipe your hands on your pants just yet. Go back to ‘Goals’ regularly and check in. Jane and I made it a point to look at the dashboard every Monday. It became a ritual, a pep talk for our sales minions. 

Monitor your progress, adjust targets if need be. This isn’t Etch A Sketch; it’s more like sculpting clay. Gentle adjustments ensure we hit our targets without driving ourselves to madness.

## The Aftermath

Weeks passed, coffee cups multiplied, and guess what? Our team hit the targets. The joy was palpable. We high-fived in a manner that would make Olympic athletes jealous. Pipedrive didn't just demystify target setting—it made it manageable, even enjoyable.

Jane and I, we’re no superheroes, but in that moment? We were darn close. So here’s to you, setting your targets, reaching beyond, and enjoying that sweet, sweet success. 

Let’s do this!

And there you have it! Set your goals, involve your team, monitor progress, and before you know it, you'll be celebrating those wins, big or small, much like Jane and me by the office watercooler. Cheers to more caffeine-fueled victories ahead.
