# How To Track Competitor Strategies Using Google Ads

It was one of those eureka moments—half coffee-fueled haze, half suspicious curiosity—when I happened upon a Google Ads report about a cupcake shop three blocks from our office. Pink Froth Cupcakes, a tiny establishment with polka dot banners and raving fans. Comparing their success to our own humble bakery inspired a series of late nights powered by Google spreadsheets and an insatiable thirst to uncover their secret. It became our little strategic caper: game on, Pink Froth!

**Step 1: Discover the Competition**

The journey begins by simply knowing who we’re up against. Like a battle of the bulge but in digital form. We start by searching for keywords related to our business on Google. Our mission? Spot the ads plastered at the top of the search results, those sneaky devils. If Pink Froth Cupcakes appears more often than not, it means they're in the game of Google Ads, and honey, they're not playing for participation trophies.

**Step 2: Google Ads Transparency**

Not to be outsmART, Google has a transparency feature—not many know about this little gem—that lets us peek into the ad world of our competitors. By simply clicking the three-dotted menu next to an ad, we unveil the "Why this ad?" option. Think of it like peeking behind the magician's curtain. Click it, and behold, the revelation of their secret sauce: keywords, audience demographics, perhaps even a hint if they favor red velvet over vanilla.

**Step 3: The Sneaky Google Ads Preview and Diagnosis Tool**

This tool is our clandestine crystal ball. We type in our own search terms as if we were customers lost in the vast forest of sweet treats. No one will know it was us meddling in this digital arena. It reveals how Pink Froth and other ambitious confectioners use Google Ads to entice passers-by on the information superhighway. Data like ad position and performance instantly drop into our laps—simple yet powerful intel.

**Step 4: Dive into the Competitive Research with Auction Insights**

Auction Insights is like being regaled by tales of the gladiators in the digital colosseum. Here, we dive deep—analyze how often our ads appear compared to the competition and what their visibility looks like. We get swept up in a sea of relative metrics like impression share. Numbers, numbers, and more numbers, each one telling its own riveting yarn.

**Step 5: Embrace the Tools of the Trade**

To sweeten the pot, the world of ad analysis offers delightful tools such as SEMrush and SpyFu—every modern detective's sidekick. Like Batman’s gadgets but for your marketing toolkit. These tools help us scrutinize Pink Froth's campaigns like a Sherlock of cupcakes, revealing where they fumble or flaunt their adverts, and which keywords are their best charmers. It’s like having a spyglass into their strategic kitchen.

**Step 6: Reflect and Refine**

Armed with knowledge and a sprinkle of humor, we circle back. As wise warriors returning from the battlefield, we refine our own strategies. With insights from Pink Froth Cupcakes, our humble bakery can bake itself into the spotlight, weaving lessons learned into fresh campaigns. Never forget—it’s all in the journey.

Through this process, we grow and adapt, uncovering the cheeky truths about competitor strategies while slapping a delicious cherry on top of our own business endeavors. Together we share this clandestine adventure, weaving strategy and mystery into our own success stories.
