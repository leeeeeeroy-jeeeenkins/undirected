# Understanding Google Ads Attribution Models

A few years back, my colleague Tanya and I were embroiled in a spirited debate over coffee, attempting to decipher the mind-boggling world of Google Ads attribution. It's one of those discussions you unintendedly find yourself having—like debating the merits of pineapple on pizza. Anyway, I remember her exclaiming, "Why does this have to be so convoluted?" And I, with mock solemnity, replied, "Because advertisers enjoy a twisty puzzle!" That moment of shared bewilderment led us on a quest to unravel Google’s mysterious attribution models.

## The First Touch: Fear and Loathing in Data

Picture it's Monday, and we're staring at our sales data—it's as cryptic as a Shakespearean sonnet. We're both scratching our heads, Tanya more so because she hadn’t had her second cup of coffee yet. In understanding the first touch attribution, imagine someone taking credit just for saying “hi” at a party. With this model, our first interaction with a customer gets all the glory. Whether it's the blog they found or the ad they spotted while bleary-eyed on a Tuesday morning commute, first touch can seem like the alpha in our advertising story. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. 

The simplicity of the first touch is appealing. It's like the song you can hum along to because it has only three chords. You can easily track how many customers first discovered us through our compelling SEO efforts. But alas, sometimes simplicity doesn't capture the entire rambunctious flow of interaction.

## Last Touch: The Grand Finale That Matters

As we sipped on our caramel-infused brews, we moved on to last touch attribution. Picture this: a customer is finally convinced to buy our product after seeing an ad—our ad, with Tanya’s brilliant copywriting, thank you very much—after a hundred interactions. Last touch attribution comes in, claiming victory like the superhero who arrives at the climax of a movie, stealing the show.

This model affords the final interaction the coveted visibility on our dashboard. But let’s admit it, life isn’t just about grand finales. People fall in love, buy things, and make decisions through a series of events—not moments of flashy, intense proclamations.

## Multi-Touch: Like a Mosaic of Insights

Tanya, with her newfound curiosity, suggested we explore multi-touch attribution. Here’s where things start feeling like an art project rather than a spreadsheet—each touchpoint gets its moment in the sun. 

In the multi-touch world, every interaction is a brushstroke on our customer’s canvas. It's holistic, like hearing the jazz ensemble in its entirety instead of focusing on just the trumpet solo. We pour over reports showing varied credit assignments—a delightful synchrony of weighted interactions—feasting our eyes on the stories our data tells.

## The Joy of Discovery

In the end, amidst frivolous debates and endless coffee cups, what we discovered was how these models weren’t just about hard numbers. They’re like the symphony behind someone deciding to buy. It’s about understanding and appreciating every interaction's role in the customer journey. 

As we look back at that conversation in the cozy corner of our favorite café, we chuckle, now relishing in our little victories over complex models. This journey has been as absurd and delightful as finding a new favorite series to binge-watch. Together, let’s embrace the chaos and find pure, unadulterated joy in the dance of data and discovery.
