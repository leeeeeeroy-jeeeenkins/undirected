# How to Automate Your Workflow with Freshworks CRM

Let's rewind to last summer when the ice cream truck sang its merry tune outside and productivity became an elusive creature—like a cat at bath time. My desk was a battlefield, invoices and sticky notes poured forth like confetti at some deranged parade. Yet amidst that chaos, salvation materialized under the guise of Freshworks CRM. I heard it from a buddy, Mike, who casually mentioned, "Hey, you should automate your setup." And thus began our journey toward enlightenment.

## A Dance with Dashboards

There we were, wide-eyed and frayed, staring at Freshworks’ sleek interface. The dashboard seemed alive, pulsating with possibilities. You know that feeling when you discover a new app and midway realize you've been using 10% of your smartphone's potential all along? Yeah, this was it, only better. It was like someone handing you a magic wand—minus the glitter mess.

Mike and I decided to automate lead scoring. You just click on "Contacts," whisper sweet nothings as you select "Auto Profile Enrichment" and watch the magic. Names, emails, social profiles—all filled in automatically. Boom. No longer would we fumble in the dark, clasping blindly for info morsels like desperate raccoons.

## The Symphony in Email

Fast forward to Tuesday afternoon. Mike had just spilled coffee over his keyboard—a classic undo every tech nerd moment—while explaining how Freshworks could automate emails. No sweat. We sauntered over to the "Marketing Automation" section. Crafting an email sequence was like composing a love letter to potential clients—only less awkward if things went sideways.

You simply select "Create a Journey," map it out like you'd plan a surprise birthday bash but with fewer balloons and more logic, and let the bots do the serenading. The delight of having emails sent at the perfect time, like clockwork, was—I tell you—satisfying in a way that bordered on art.

## Deals and Unicorns

If emails were the overture, deals were the crescendo. Remember that thrilling moment when you make it to the final boss in a video game, palms sweaty, heartbeat a rock concert? That's what closing deals felt like. Mike, who always believed in celebrating small victories—we threw an imaginary party each time a deal was closed without human intervention. We enabled automation right in the "Sales Pipeline."

Freshworks CRM seamlessly moved deals from one stage to another like an attentive butler in a lavish mansion. We even automated reminders—soft nudges—so nothing slipped through like a ninja in the dead of night. Sales reps became wizards, weaving success potions. Pure auditory bliss.

## Riding the Customer Wave

Let’s not forget customer support, the unsung hero in this digital opera! Imagine grievances sorted before reaching our zen-like calm. Freshworks swooped in with AI—glorious swooshes of chatbots and autoresponders—easing customer woes or directing them smoothly to the right human. It was like having customer service surge gently like a summer tide without fear of drowning in complaints.

## Reflecting on Our Digital Ballet

Thus, as the sun set—drawing the curtain on our myriad triumphs—we embraced this technological waltz. Automating with Freshworks CRM had transformed a once discordant pandemonium into a ballet of efficiency. And though Mike may still scald himself with coffee, our workflow now glided effortlessly. The future, dear friends, isn't just automated. It's fabulous.

And for those still entangled in sticky notes and clamor, consider automation. Because sometimes, you just need to let robots do the heavy lifting while we dance through a frosty, altogether brighter, tomorrow. Cheers to unleashing time, one automated task at a time.
