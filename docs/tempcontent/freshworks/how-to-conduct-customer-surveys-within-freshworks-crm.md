# How to Conduct Customer Surveys Within Freshworks CRM

It started with a simple question from Lisa at marketing, "How do our customers *really* feel about our support?" We, being the curious folk we are, decided to dive headfirst into the depths of customer sentiment. So, there we were - a motley crew of sales, marketing, and support experts, huddled around a computer, ready to navigate the labyrinthine world of customer surveys within Freshworks CRM.

## Setting the Scene

You know what’s funky? We didn’t even know we could conduct surveys within Freshworks CRM until Steve, our IT wizard, casually mentioned it. He was deep into his 3:00 PM coffee - dark roast with a splash of vanilla creamer, just like clockwork. So, thanks to Steve and his caffeinated wisdom, we embarked on this adventure.

### Step 1: Define Your Survey Objective

First things first, you can't just start asking questions willy-nilly. What's the purpose here? Are we gauging customer satisfaction, digging into the depths of product feedback, or maybe just trying to figure out why Phil always gets rave reviews in customer support? We decided on customer satisfaction - Lisa’s initial concern. 

**Protip 🔥:** Shun generic objectives, be clear and specific. “Figuring out why customers think Phil's support is out of this world” sounds way cooler than “check customer's opinion on support.”

### Step 2: Craft the Survey

Just like Aunt Margie’s apple pies need careful crafting, so does your survey. Log into Freshworks CRM, and head over to the 'Admin Settings' - don't worry, it’s not like the dungeon in your basement, more like a cozy, well-lit room filled with possibilities. Go to ‘Customer Experience’ and click on ‘Surveys’. 

We put our heads together like we were writing the next great American novel. Keep questions short, sweet, and to the point. We stuck with five questions, not too much, not too little - it was the Goldilocks approach to survey questions.

**Key Questions:**
1. How satisfied are you with our support?
2. Was your issue resolved promptly?
3. How would you rate the friendliness of our support team?
4. Do you have any additional comments or suggestions?
5. On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend us?

### Step 3: Customize and Personalize

With our questions ready, we decided to get classy. In Freshworks CRM, there’s an option to customize design. Jennie, our graphic designer, suggested using a light blue palette because it’s calming. Steve added in, between sips of coffee, “Make sure you add a personal touch.” So, we slapped on our logo and a heartwarming thank-you note - “Your feedback makes us better. Thank you!”

**Protip 🔥:** Personalization goes beyond customization. Add that extra sprinkle of magic like personalized greeting - "Hey [Customer Name], you rock!"

### Step 4: Test, Tweak, and Send

Next, we gave it a dry run. Bob from accounting got our test survey (lucky Bob). After a few tweaks - mainly rephrasing question 3 because Bob thought we were asking about *their* friendliness - we were ready to rumble. 

Sending the survey in Freshworks CRM is as easy as pie. With the survey ready, we selected our audience, and boom! Out it went.

**Protip 🔥:** Timing is everything, sending it too soon ruins the broth, delay it and it goes stale. We found the sweet spot was within 24 hours after support interactions.

### Conclusion: Sift Through the Gold

Gather ‘round for the results! With responses flowing in, we used Freshworks’ neat report features to analyze the feedback. Lisa had tears of joy (no lie), and Phil… well, turns out Phil is basically a customer support rockstar. We learned so much about what we were doing right and what needed some TLC.

So, there you have it, folks. Our adventure in the land of customer surveys within Freshworks CRM. It's not just about collecting data; it's about connecting, improving, and sometimes discovering a Phil in your team. 

And remember, just like Steve’s coffee-fueled epiphanies, sometimes the best ideas come when you’re least expecting them. Happy surveying!
