# How to Set Up Lead Scoring in Freshworks CRM

So there we were, sipping our third cup of coffee on a drizzly Wednesday morning, staring at a sea of names and numbers. Freshworks CRM stared back at us, as if expecting us to make the first move. Our leads felt like puzzle pieces dumped on a table—exciting and overwhelming at the same time. Optimism mixed with a tinge of frustration, but without a clear picture, how could we know where to start?

## The Moment of Clarity

Ah, remember Jim from sales? Always the optimist, he sauntered in with his usual swagger. "Why don't we set up lead scoring?" he said, as if it was the most obvious solution in the world. It felt like a light bulb had finally flickered to life in the back of my over-caffeinated brain. Lead scoring—of course. Let’s turn those disjointed names into a well-oiled decision-making machine.

### Step 1: Define Your Criteria

First, we had to decide what really mattered to us. Because let's face it, not all leads are created equal. Small startups, large enterprises, folks who have shown interest versus those sort-of-kind-of interested. We needed criteria, like a secret recipe handed down through generations.

Here's where we got specific: We considered the engagement score, demographic information, and behavior on our website. Our ideal lead looked like this: someone who had visited the pricing page at least twice, attended one webinar, and was from a company with more than 50 employees. We chuckled over the absurdity of it, but hey, specifics matter.

### Step 2: Configure Lead Score Rules in Freshworks CRM

Alright, buckle up. Time to flip switches in Freshworks CRM.

1. **Navigate to Admin Settings:** Click on 'Admin Settings' in Freshworks CRM. It's like opening the control panel of a spaceship. Dramatic, but accurate.
2. **Lead Scoring:** Find 'Lead Scoring' under 'Automation & Scoring.' Click it as if it owes you money.
3. **Add a New Rule:** Tap ‘Add Rule.’ This is where the magic starts. We felt a bit like Gandalf, wielding our CRM staff.
4. **Define Conditions:** Enter our tailor-made criteria. We picked attributes like 'number of visits to pricing page,' engagement in webinars, and company size. Each got a point value, like calories in our morning lattes.
5. **Set Scores:** Assign the actual scores. Our pricing page visitor got a solid 10 points, the webinar attendee another 10, and the company size added 15. Just like building a LEGO, piece by piece.

### Step 3: Test and Tweak

Of course, the first draft wasn't perfect—think of it as a rough sketch. We needed to see it in action. Jim's leads were our guinea pigs, and he took it like a champ.

Over a couple of weeks, we watched the scores roll in. Some leads shot to the top, while others languished in the single digits. We tweaked the criteria, gave fewer points for single page visits, more for multiple interactions. It felt like tweaking a recipe: a pinch here, a dash there.

### A Happy Ending

The tedious afternoons morphed into efficient mornings. Instead of sifting through hundreds of questionable leads, we had a shortlist of the most promising ones. We celebrated with coffee (again), and Jim got some new kicks—he said he needed them to walk to all his successful meetings.

Setting up lead scoring in Freshworks CRM turned out to be our golden ticket. It was more than just a feature; it was our invisible ally in the vast world of sales. It felt like giving a high-five to our past selves for a job well done. And let's not forget the collective sigh of relief—echoed by the entire team.

So next time you find yourself drowning in a sea of leads, remember Jim’s swagger. Lead scoring, my friends. Let’s make sense of the chaos, one score at a time.

Till next time, happy scoring!
