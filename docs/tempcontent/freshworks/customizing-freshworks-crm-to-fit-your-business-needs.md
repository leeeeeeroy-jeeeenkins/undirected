# Customizing Freshworks CRM to Fit Your Business Needs

Once, over an unseasonably warm autumn weekend – hot coffee clutched during an all-day brainstorming session in my cluttered home office – we struggled with our CRM. Our team needed something that fit like a glove but were stuck with what felt like an unwieldy gauntlet. That's when we discovered Freshworks CRM. And let me tell you, the thrill of unwrapping a tool that could grow and mold with us felt like finally stepping into sneakers after a lifetime of wearing clogs. What followed was a journey into customization that brought us from stiff to seamless.

### The Day We Met Our CRM Match

Have you ever had one of those moments where a new, shiny tool promises to solve all your problems – only to drop the ball with each click that doesn’t quite fit your process? Picture this: tabs open like a cacophony of doors in the whirlwind of a midday storm. That's what our initial days with Freshworks were like - until the moment we realized it wasn't the tool, it was us needing to make it ours.

The first step was understanding that what we needed wasn't out-of-the-box; it was tucked inside like a surprise Easter egg. We huddled, tea in hand to calm our caffeine jitters – or was that excitement? – and went exploring into the wild lands of Freshworks settings.

### The Daily Customized Grind 

Imagine if your CRM felt like the coffee shop that knows your order by heart, the barista who's prepping your Spanish latte just the way you like it by the time you reach the counter. That's what Freshworks became for us, but it didn't happen overnight.

We started with the dashboards. Out went the clutter, those widgets that reminded us of that drawer stuffed with odds and ends that you swear you'll organize someday. One afternoon filled with tunes from a random playlist and an ironically motivational podcast, we carved out a dashboard that only displayed what mattered: leads, deals, a quirky sales report for Heather – she of the humorously color-coded charts.

As we adjusted, it was a bit like repainting a room while still living in it. Engagements grew, clutter shrank, the endless scroll of irrelevant info stopped! Every tweak felt like an "aha!" moment shared during those snug mornings where the heating didn’t quite reach the far corner of the office. Freshworks started to feel like a well-placed slice in a day full of pineapple pizza.

### Automate to Elevate

Something magical happens when automation kicks in. It's like watching your favorite choreographed dance number – everything just clicks in place. Our automation adventure with Freshworks was the same. 

We started with baby steps in workflows. The world slowed as our processes sped up, the industrial noise of repetitive tasks replaced by a symphony of algorithmic grace. Notifications about overdue tasks danced seamlessly from tabs to our eyes, singing harmonies in our customized circus of productivity. The thrill when a lead seamlessly moved categories because of an email reply? It was a cha-cha of digital delight.

### Freshworks Finale

There we were, down the road, our CRM skipping along beside us as if it had always known the way. Customization ultimately brought us closer as a team and to our ambitious goals. Before Freshworks, we were like hikers without a map, hopeful but flailing. With it, we became explorers who knew precisely where north was, occasionally detoured by a pit stop for cinnamon rolls – Jack's treat, of course.

Now, days of staring at convoluted screens replaced by crisp, concise interactions. And if you listen closely enough to our side of the office, maybe you’ll catch the quiet serenade of our CRM, singing our tune – with no out-of-sync clicks to break the rhythm.
