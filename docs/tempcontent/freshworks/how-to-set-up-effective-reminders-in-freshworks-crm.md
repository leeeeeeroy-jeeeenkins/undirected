# How to Set Up Effective Reminders in Freshworks CRM

There's an old joke. You know, the one about forgetting what day it is and getting reminders mixed up — kind of like me once forgetting my grandma's birthday and learning the hard way. It was a charmingly awkward moment, as I was standing there with a sheepish smile and a last-minute bouquet pilfered from my neighbor's garden. I’d forgotten to set a reminder. That's when I realized the untapped magic of CRM systems like Freshworks — our digital assistants waiting quietly for us to master them like wizards learning our spells. Today, we'll embark on a journey to ensure we never find ourselves in such a pickle again.

## Discovering the Reminder Rituals

As we delve into Freshworks CRM, imagine it's like opening a treasure chest — not in a pirate sense but more as a collector of precious time. Setting up reminders here is akin to installing a small, friendly voice whispering "psst... don't forget grandma" — except it's a lot more efficient and less cryptic.

To begin: Log into your Freshworks CRM account. Yeah, not the most thrilling step but don’t wander off — this is where it all starts, like the adventure of learning to ride a bicycle.

### The Art of Creating Reminders

Once you're in, find yourself on the dashboard — it's like the captain's deck. Click on any 'Contacts' or 'Leads’ tab, where the real meat of your CRM life lies. As I stumbled through this process, the simplicity of it made me laugh, perhaps out of relief or at the realization of how close simplicity and complexity can dance together.

1. Choose your contact – it could be Grandma or that client you love more than sunshine. Click 'Edit' in their profile, where you'll find their whole life laid out like an open book.

2. Here comes the magical step: in the 'Reminders’ section (yes, it’s right there under your nose), you can add a reminder. It’s like a digital sticky note that won’t abandon you at the bottom of your bag.

3. Set the reminder time and date. Imagine it's like aligning the stars for that perfect moment, ensuring the universe conspires in your favor.

4. Save it. This is where the real magic happens, and Freshworks transforms into your trusty sidekick.

## Mastering the Reminder Wizardry

There I was, reminders set like a finely tuned orchestra ready to play its symphony. And yet, let's be honest, the real test is in the listening, not just the composing. So, ensure notifications are enabled on your CRM — this is paramount, like turning your phone's volume on before a concert.

Poke around the 'Settings' — deliberate in their stillness but oh, how powerful. Find the 'Notifications’ and make sure you choose the preferred method of delivery: email, SMS, carrier pigeon (just kidding, but we can dream).

## The Grand Finale

And there it is — a process so seemingly simple yet efficacious. Like Grandma's birthday cake recipe, passed down and perfected, Freshworks CRM becomes our tool to craft a life kept orderly and loving — one reminder at a time. Oh, and never underestimate the power of a well-set reminder; it might just save you from apologetic bouquets and sheepish smiles.

Together, we've turned a confounding task into a shared ritual, a digital tale spun with care. We’ve become time-travellers, journeying from oversight to foresight, armed only with our Freshworks CRM and a good story.
