# How to Customize Freshworks CRM Notifications

You know that feeling when your phone pings, and you wonder if it's life-changing news or just another notification begging for your attention? I had one such moment last Tuesday when, instead of a message from my mate Jake about our weekend plans, I got a bland, emotionless notification from Freshworks CRM that could have been exciting but felt like reading a phone book on a dreary day. That’s when I realized—I needed to jazz up those notifications.

## Diving Into Notifications

Ah, settings. The sanctuary where all frustrations turn into manageable tasks. The first lessons of customization always start here. Let's head into Freshworks CRM—let's call it Fresh for short—and take the plunge.

1. **Log In:** Start by signing in to your Fresh account. If you have two-factor authentication on, you’ll feel almost like a secret agent bypassing Laser Grid defences as you slide into your dashboard.
2. **Settings:** Once in, glide your cursor over to your profile icon neatly nestled at the top right and click on 'Settings.' It’s like opening a treasure chest.
3. **Notifications:** In the Settings menu, click on ‘Notifications’. Here lies our golden ticket to a happier notification experience, a canvas of endless possibilities.

## Picking Your Notification Poison

I still remember when I picked a default notification sound that was so high-pitched, my dog would perform a salsa dance to it. Now, Fresh gives us more refined choices.

1. **Customize Alerts:** From the Notifications page, you’ll see various notification categories like Emails, Tasks, and Deals. Select the one you want to customize—imagine you're curating a playlist, each alert a different tune.
2. **Email Notifications:** Click on 'Email' and you can decide whether you want a notification every time someone sneezes at your company or just when something important happens. Toggle switches like a rockstar hitting the right notes—on/off, on/off.
3. **In-App Notifications:** Besides emails, we have the neat option of in-app notifications. Tap on what you want to hear about without having to leave the app. It’s like having an assistant who whispers instead of screams.

## Digging Deeper

Remember Kate from customer success? She used to get so many superfluous notifications that one day she just turned them all off. Let’s not be like Kate.

1. **Tailor Specifics:** For more precision, dive into each notification type. For instance, under 'Deals,’ you can specify notifications for deal creation, closure, and updates. You don't want to miss Bobby from Sales closing another high-value deal!
2. **Custom Rules:** And guess what? You can even create custom rules for notifications. It's like telling Fresh, “Hey, let me know only if the deal value exceeds $10,000 and throw in a little confetti emoji.” Navigate to Automation -> Workflows and craft your bespoke alert system.
3. **Silence Until Ready:** When you need that zen moment, enable 'Do Not Disturb.' Our notifications will wait, respectfully, until we’re ready to emerge from our meditative cocoon.

## Testing Out Your Masterpiece

Sebastian once told me, “Never trust a notification you’ve never heard before.” Wise, right? So, test your new settings!

Send test emails or create a deal to see how Fresh sings now. If the experiences are pleasant and your phone isn’t hosting a twenty-piece orchestra, you’ve balanced it right. Readjust as needed until the notifications feel like a soft nudge rather than an overly eager poke.

## Final Thoughts

So, there we have it. A kaleidoscope of customization at our fingertips, ready to turn dull into delightful. It’s not just about surviving the workday, but making little parts of it sing. Customize your Fresh notifications and transform each ping into a mini-celebration. Now, if you excuse me, I must check if Jake ever sent that message. Cheers!
