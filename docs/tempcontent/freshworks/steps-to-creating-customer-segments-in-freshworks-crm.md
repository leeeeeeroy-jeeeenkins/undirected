# Steps to Creating Customer Segments in Freshworks CRM

Once upon a digital canvas, there we were, grappling with a tangled web of customer data. Elbows deep in spreadsheets and mind-numbed by endless email lists, our brains practically cried out for a way to make sense of it all. What we needed—the proverbial lightbulb moment—was segmentation, splendid and organized. And thus, our journey with Freshworks CRM began, a tale as delightful as a puppy-piling in your lap. Let’s dive in and discover how to wrangle that customer chaos into neat little segments that work wonders for our business strategies.

## Recognizing the Puzzle Pieces

Oh, the thrill of realizing that each customer, much like your grandmother's eclectic patchwork quilt, has unique patterns and colors! Our first step was akin to sorting socks: identifying which pieces fit together. In Freshworks CRM, we channeled this epiphany by compiling data on demographics, purchase history, and interaction levels. It felt like poring over a favorite book, each piece of data a paragraph in the customer’s story. We giggled at the peculiarities—like the customer who only shopped on moonlit Wednesdays—each datum a thread in the tapestry.

## Diving into the CRM: Setting Parameters

Freshworks greeted us like an old friend, its interface welcoming us with open arms. We set off by selecting the *Contacts* module—our digital stage for this segmentation masterpiece. It was crucial to decide the parameters: was it age, location, or those whimsical shopping habits? The criteria needed careful curation, much like picking toppings for a pizza where harmony is key. As we clicked away, creating filters felt more like the thrill of a treasure hunt than merely completing a task. Our parameters in place, we sat back momentarily satisfied—this was the dawn of a new organizing era.

## Applying Filters: The Moment of Clarity

Click, click, and more click. It was as if Freshworks came alive, pulsing with energy as we applied each filter, watching customer profiles sort like M&M’s—reds over there, blues to the left. We tailored filters as if customizing outfits for a grand gala. Funny enough, our CRM excitement seemed contagious, with coworkers peeking over our shoulders, drawn to the beauty of apparent order from chaos. "Who's next?" we pondered, sipping cold coffee—our faithful brainstorming brew. It all began to make sense, like the setup of a well-directed play, each actor (customer segment) ready with their motives.

## Saving and Savoring the Segments

On this segmentation journey, the power of clicking 'save' felt surprisingly monumental. We saved our crafted segments, giving them names as we might with cherished pets—playful and descriptive. "Weekend Warriors," for instance, was the segment filled with weekend shoppers who often indulged in spur-of-the-moment purchases. Freshworks CRM allowed us to effortlessly revisit them, much like returning home after travels. And yet, it provided flexibility too, adapting as our understanding of customers evolved, as dynamic and curious as life itself.

## Reflecting on the Journey

As we eyed our segmented universe like a proud gardener admiring a freshly-bloomed garden, there was silence, filled with potential and anticipation. Segmenting in Freshworks had metamorphosed our work life—like turning on a light in a dim room, suddenly everything was illuminated. We realized that this story wasn’t just about fostering business relationships, oh no; it was about understanding, personalizing, and building bridges with those across the screen. It was a dance—a joyous, purposeful dance.

There you have it! Remember, every customer is their own story. Segments? They are simply chapters waiting to be read.

WHO knew organization could be this exhilarating?
