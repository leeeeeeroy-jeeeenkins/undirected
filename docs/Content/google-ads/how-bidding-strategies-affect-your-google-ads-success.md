# How Bidding Strategies Affect Your Google Ads Success

Let me take you back to a balmy afternoon, not too long ago, when Susan and I sat huddled at our favorite café, painstakingly sipping the world's slowest iced coffee—our attention fully absorbed by the cryptic labyrinth of Google Ads. The amber hue of the setting sun enveloped us, casting shadows that seemed to whisper "optimizations." We weren't new to this digital carnival, yet every foray felt like our maiden voyage into uncharted waters. Our aim was modest, really—to give our little homegrown business an online nudge, or perhaps a gentle shove, towards success. Despite our bravest faces, we were stumbling over mysterious terms like "bidding strategies." My faint whisper, “How hard can it possibly be?”, hung in the air like an unanswered riddle.

## The Great Unveiling of Manual VS Automated Bidding 

It was a moment of clarity—or chaos, depending on your perspective—when Susan decided to go rogue and tried manual bidding. I had to admire her audacity. We spent evenings—eyes heavy yet determined—setting precise bids for keywords, feeling like digital architects of our own destiny. Manual bidding gave us control, a grip on our budget—a sensation akin to steering a majestic ship in stormy seas. Running out of steam taught us one thing: it’s heavily demanding. We discovered, the hard way, that manual bids can outperform when meticulously cared for, yet may falter—it’s like grooming a pet snail to win a marathon. 

Then, curiosity led us to the automation side. Imagine a universe where machines whispered promises of higher CTRs. Automated bidding was like hiring a savvy partner who claimed to know better than us—you know, like Susan’s uncle who insists pineapple on pizza is universal truth. Remarkably, algorithms took over and managed bids with precise intent, adjusting dynamically as the campaign raged forward, often translating into more clicks, albeit at a cost: relinquishing control.

## The Art of Selecting the Right Strategy

Swiveling in coffee-stained chairs, Susan and I embarked on finding the Holy Grail of bidding strategies. Each method was like considering spices for an elaborate dish; too little and it’s bland, too much and it’s inedible. Target CPA on one hand, promising conversions, seemed inviting. It felt like putting a leash on our unruly spending. But oh, Target ROAS was our secret crush, desiring a dazzling return on our shoestring investments. With bated breaths, we discovered that choosing wrong spells doom; much like picking a horror movie when you just wanted rom-com vibes.

A finish line peek told us this: tie strategy to our campaign goals. Always revisit, and yes, tinker ‘til we sound like someone excessively using a British accent after watching too many episodes of “Sherlock.” 

## Reflecting on Trial and Triumph

As the café closed, light fading into a dim glow, we realized how whimsical and utterly absurd these journeys could be. We arrived at an understanding that every ad campaign has personality—sometimes it's cranky, sometimes mirroring genius—and our choice of strategy merely complements it. We giggled knowingly about our bumbling quest, sharing a silent camaraderie, unwittingly becoming the odd yet capable explorers of Google Ads.

In this voyage, the lesson was vivid: failure is the greatest tutor, patience is a virtue, and hope springs eternal from every sunrise...or ad click. As we now speak from gentle wisdom, we invite you to helm your own ship. May it sail fast, furious, and unmistakably personalized, in the wondrous world of Google Ads!
