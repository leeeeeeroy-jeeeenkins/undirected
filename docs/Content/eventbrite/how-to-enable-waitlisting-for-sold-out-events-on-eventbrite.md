# How to Enable Waitlisting for Sold Out Events on Eventbrite

There we were, huddled in my kitchen – the unofficial headquarters for last-minute event planning. My cat, Mr. Whiskers, sat perched on the counter, judging us silently. The conversation was heated: every single ticket for our charity concert—a delightfully acoustic evening—had sold out in a heartbeat. This was both a triumph and a nightmare. Joy, our metaphorical head chef in event organizing, exclaimed, "We need a waitlist!" Her enthusiasm was infectious, though at the moment, I had as much faith in setting up a waitlist as I did in Mr. Whiskers hosting the event himself. But we were determined. And so began our experimental foray into the digital nuances of Eventbrite.  

## The Waitlist Odyssey Begins

Picture us staring at my laptop screen (with Mr. Whiskers nibbling at the power cord) as if it were speaking in tongues. Enabling a waitlist on Eventbrite, though, turned out to be delightfully straightforward. Here's the recipe we uncovered for this not-so-secret sauce:

### Start the Event Engine

First things first, login to your Eventbrite account. Then navigate to your event dashboard—the control panel where all the magic happens. Joy insisted on reading every piece of fine print while nursing her infamous herbal tea, but for those of us not possessed by such patience, the dashboard is where our adventure takes off. 

### Channeling the Waitlist Energy

In your event's "Manage" section, there's a tab labeled "Order Options." Click it with the eagerness of a kid opening Christmas presents. A drop-down menu appears, and there it is: Waitlist. Was it there all along, waving at us? We’ll never know. Click on “Waitlist Settings”—a charming little button that greets you with possibilities. 

### Activate the Waitlist

Now comes the part where we laughed at how simple things can seem in hindsight. Once inside Waitlist Settings, flick the switch to "On." It’s a euphoric moment akin to turning on a fairy light display. Now, customize it. Decide how many tickets each hopeful fan can request. Do you want to manually confirm waitlist orders, or let Eventbrite handle the minutiae? Choose wisely, weary travelers. 

Here's our pro tip: if you know your audience—like Sarah knows her obsession with vintage polka-dotted everything—add a message for those joining the waitlist. With Joy's input, ours read, "Hope floats on this waitlist!"

### Save and Celebrate

With a breeze of a click on the “Save” button, you’ve successfully activated the waitlist. Cue the celebratory music! It’s as if you were hosting sold-out shows for digital Genies. 

## Reflecting on the Digital Magic

In the end, we were heroes to our concert-goers, some of whom shared their gratitude by penning short poems—or offering Mr. Whiskers extra treats. Our kitchen had transformed from a hub of frantic energy to a place of camaraderie and newfound expertise. Setting up a waitlist wasn't just a technical task, it was a lesson in embracing new opportunities.

We discovered that Eventbrite's tools aren't just there to confound us, they're allies in our quests to connect people through shared experiences. So there you have it, from our kitchen to yours—or wherever you choose to conduct such delightful mischief. Activate your waitlist, and may your digital paths be ever vibrant with eager attendees.
