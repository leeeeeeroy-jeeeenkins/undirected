# Best Practices for Drift Lead Scoring

I remember the first time I sat down with a sales team that couldn't wait to tell me about their newfound obsession: lead scoring. It was an unusually bright Tuesday, the kind where the sun seems to dance through the window blinds, and Lisa, our tireless sales manager, had brought in homemade cookies — I think her secret ingredient was a touch of cinnamon magic. Over warm chocolate chip indulgence, we discussed Drift lead scoring, and it struck me how analytical enthusiasm can coexist with profound uncertainty.

We quickly realized that lead scoring isn't just a numbers game. It involves nuanced interactions, human judgment, and a sprinkle of intuition. Let’s dive into some best practices we unearthed, with a dash of that high-energy curiosity we felt that clear Tuesday morning.

## Understanding Your Leads – The Who, The What, and The How

Now, imagine we're sipping coffee — not that weak, insipid office brew but a full-bodied, willing-to-make-you-stay kind of coffee. This is where understanding your lead begins. Every lead isn't just a data point; they're individuals with quirks, needs, and potential — like us. One day, Chad from accounting shared a story about how his coffee preference led to a spontaneous networking chat that turned into a big opportunity. 

First things first, we compiled a list of characteristics that we thought defined our leads. Are they frequent visitors? Do they download whitepapers — seemingly out of sheer curiosity or real intent? We categorized behaviors that led to conversion-like behavior, akin to plotting lattes per day to mood graphs. 

It's important to start simple. Familiarize yourself with high-value actions that resonate with your business's goals and map them out. Our revelation: the most engaged prospects were reading case studies. And who says light reading can't be revealing?

## Building a Lead Scoring Model – The Experiment

Lisa’s homemade cookies turned into annual traditions, but let’s get back to serious business. We started plotting a plan — not the cookie heist kind — but a model that mirrored the journey of our leads. Picture one of those mad scientist boards, except instead of equations, we had sticky notes.

We considered both activity-based scores — things like site visits and emails sent — and demographic scores — think job titles or industry. It’s tempting to give high points to CEOs, but sometimes it’s their trusty right-hand marketing player pulling the strings. Balance, as Yoda might say, is key. 

We set preliminary scores and adjusted them based on feedback. This wasn’t an overnight success story; it was our version of a soap opera, filled with plot twists and cliffhangers. The key was to remain flexible. If webinars started to double as cat videos (hello, engagement), we adjusted points accordingly. It was all about iteration.

## Continual Adjustment – The Ongoing Sartorial Adventure

As with any great adventure, the sequel is always in development. Drift lead scoring isn’t static. It requires periodic checks — kind of like cleaning out a digital attic, minus the spiders. Chad, in his infinite wisdom, lends us his analogy: “It’s like trying new ties until one sticks,” he mused, as he tried on his fourth polka-dotted one for the day.

Regularly reviewing which scored actions actually lead to sales is crucial. Something as simple as attending a virtual event might rise in score once its value becomes evident over time. We didn’t shy away from asking our sales and marketing teams for insights; they’re the ones in the trenches, spotting patterns that aren’t visible in dry data.

As lead scorers-by-day and cookie enthusiasts-by-night, our motto became clear: Be curious. Be brave. Let discovery pave the way. Every lead is a story, and Drift is just the beginning. A sunny Tuesday may start it, but it’s the journey — with all its trials and tasting sessions — that makes it meaningful. Cheers to leads, and to discovering what makes them click!
