# How to Use Tags in Zoho CRM

One dreary Monday morning, after the third cup of coffee but before my pre-lunch snack (a questionable decision), I found myself wrestling with our Zoho CRM. More specifically, with tags. Now, it's not that I'm tech-illiterate—far from it. But navigating business software before caffeine IV dripping into my veins is an Olympic sport. This story isn’t groundbreaking; it's a mere slice from my mundane life but boy, did it change how I view tags. If you’re nodding along, ready to either learn or commiserate, let’s dive in together, hoof in hoof.

## Getting Started with Tags

Picture this: you're preparing to wrangle a herd of data. You'd want to tag each with the precision of an experienced cattle herder, right? That’s where Zoho CRM tags come into play. Now, take a deep breath. We're in this together.

### Step 1: Accessing Tags
First, we need to access those little lifesavers:
1. Open Zoho CRM that, like a faithful but slightly exasperating mule, waits for us.
2. Head to the module. Any module—Leads, Contacts, Accounts—choose your pick. I clicked on “Leads” because, like a treasure hunter, that's where I wanted to start.
3. Select the record. If an absent-minded squirrel can do it, so can we.
4. Look for the “Add Tags” option. Ah, there it is. Almost like it was hiding from us—cheeky little thing.

### Step 2: Adding Tags
The next part is almost fun—like sticking labels on neatly packed jam jars in Grandma’s pantry:
1. Click on “Add Tags.”
2. Type whatever tickles your fancy. Not literally. Make it relevant. "Follow-up," "Urgent," "Pending Approval"; you get the gist.
3. Hit “Save.”

At this point, I felt a triumphant swell rise within me. We were just getting started.

## Managing Your Tags

Remember Mrs. Paisley, my fourth-grade teacher? Like her meticulous classroom arrangements, tag management in Zoho can bring order to chaos.

### Step 1: View All Tags
Want to see what culinary delights of tags we have so far?
1. Navigate to the Settings icon—like spelunking through a cave because software can’t just make it easy.
2. Click on “Tags.” Voilà! A list as comprehensive as Mrs. Paisley’s spelling tests.

### Step 2: Deleting Tags
Ever created a tag that, on reflection, is as useful as a chocolate teapot?
1. Select “Manage Tags” from the same Tags section.
2. Hover—like a vulture (but with better intentions)—over the offender.
3. Click “Delete,” indulging in a liberating sense of decluttering.

## Using Tags for Segmentation

It's like that time Pete and I sorted my record collection by genre. Weird and wonderful categories like “Jazz that sounds like a Sunday morning” or “90s Screamo about Fish”. Tags help us perform similar feats of wonder and delight with our data.

### Step 1: Filter Records by Tags
Want to find all those leads you marked as “Urgent” during your coffee-fueled frenzy?
1. Go to your chosen module. Let’s stick with "Leads."
2. Click on the “Filter” icon—imagine it as a treasure map leading to what you seek.
3. Select “Tag.” Input "Urgent" and witness the list magically condense.

### Step 2: Creating Custom Views
It's like having a secret menu only you know about:
1. Navigate to “Create View” in your module of choice.
2. Input your criteria—choose “Tags” and type in your custom keyword.
3. Name your view. Be as grand or mundane as you like. Save it.

## Conclusion

That Monday shifted from dreary to victorious. We’ve navigated the jungle of Zoho CRM tags and tamed the wilds of our data chaos. With tags, we’re like mapmakers, navigating and organizing our world, making it less a tumult of random events and more like a beautifully tended garden. As Pete would say, "It's not about the tags, mate. It's about how you wield them." And maybe, just maybe, we've had a bit of fun along the way.
