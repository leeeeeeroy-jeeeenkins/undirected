# How To Perform A HubSpot Data Audit

### A Sweater in Summer

I remember the sticky, humid day vividly—an odd setting for a digital epiphany. The A/C was on the fritz, and I was muttering to myself about data discrepancies as sweat trickled down my back. Our team was drowning in incomplete HubSpot metrics, and something had to give. If only I had known sooner that a straightforward HubSpot data audit could turn this digital mess into actionable insights.

### Step 1: Identify Your Data Audit Goals

Do you remember that time when Lila’s cat mistook her server for a scratching post? Total chaos. Like that catastrophe, having no clear goal for your audit can lead to a disheveled data situation. First, underline what you need to check. Is it to verify lead data accuracy? Or maybe identify duplicate contacts? Write it all down. This is your battle plan. Trust me; this changes everything.

### Step 2: Export Your Data

Picture this: Sam was pouring over an endless spreadsheet. His eyes were practically crossing. HubSpot's interface is great, but exporting your data into a CSV file will give you the scope you need. Go to your HubSpot account, find the 'Contacts' (or other data you wish to audit), and click 'Export.' Simple enough to do while sipping coffee from your favorite mug.

### Step 3: Clean Up Your Data

Ah, the communal lunch where Gary told us about his never-ending cluttered inbox. That’s your data, too, without cleaning. Duplicate records, missing fields, invalid entries—get rid of them. Excel or Google Sheets works wonders here. Use basic functions like remove duplicates and conditional formatting. A solid playlist in the background can help turn this mundane task into something almost zen-like.

### Step 4: Verify Data Standardization

Remember when we all pitched in to organize the holiday party? Consistency was key. The same stands true for your HubSpot data. Ensure fields follow a standardized format—emails in lowercase, full names with proper capitalization, phone numbers formatted uniformly. It’s like lining up all your gadgets in neat rows—satisfying and efficient. 

### Step 5: Validate Your Lists and Segments

Katie once built the most magnificent Jenga tower, standing tall and impressive—right until the rogue table-bump. Validate your contact lists and segments to avoid that tragic collapse. Review how contacts enter these lists and ensure the criteria aren't outdated. HubSpot's filtering tools make this relatively painless, and once done, it feels like Jenga round two with even firmer blocks.

### Step 6: Regularly Audit

We learned this from watering our office plant (hi, Fred!). Regular care is what keeps things thriving. Schedule audits at regular intervals. Monthly might be too frequent—quarterly can be the sweet spot. Keep a checklist handy and spread the audit love amongst team members. It’s a task that becomes surprisingly empowering the more you practice it.

### Conclusion: A Cooler Breeze

Remember that stifling day that kicked this whole thing off? By performing a structured HubSpot data audit, it felt like someone finally fixed the A/C. The air cleared, numbers made sense, and workflow became smoother. Rob, Lila, Sam, Katie, and even Fred seem happier. 

So, start your HubSpot audit today. Let’s turn those sticky, data-swamped moments into organized, breezy days. We’ve got this.
