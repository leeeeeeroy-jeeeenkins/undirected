# How To Sync Contacts Between HubSpot And Salesforce

Last Tuesday, I found myself hunched over a steaming cup of coffee (my fourth, mind you) trying to decrypt the ancient mysteries of syncing contacts between HubSpot and Salesforce. Imagine my surprise when Lisa from marketing, bless her heart, wandered over and casually mentioned she'd been manually updating contacts between the two systems—*for months.* We exchanged glances, the kind you do when you realize you've both been soldiers in the same overcomplicated war. So let's talk about how to avoid her fate and gain back precious hours of our lives.

## The Beginning: Assessing Our Battlefield

It's 9 AM. You're armed with a double-shot espresso and the morale of a Monday morning team meeting. We're setting out to align our HubSpot and Salesforce seamlessly, creating harmonious contact symmetry between the two. First thing's first, let’s prep the battlefield. 

First, you'll need a HubSpot account with admin privileges and a Salesforce account, naturally. Think of this like preparing to cook a fancy meal—if you don’t have olive oil (read: admin rights), everything goes to shambles. Ready? Let's do this.

1. **Log in and Gain Admin Access**
    - Open HubSpot, click your profile picture (top right), and navigate to “Settings.” You'll land on a new page.
    - Do the same in Salesforce. Simple clicks, profound impact.

## Engaging the Sync: Syncing Contacts Like a Pro

The crux of our quest lies in this step, the bread to our sync sandwich. Picture me hunched (again), determining the optimal strategy while Brayden from IT fiddled with the coffee machine.

2. **Navigate the Integrations**
    - In HubSpot, find your way to the “Integration” section within Settings. It'll feel suspiciously like rummaging through a junk drawer.
    - Click “App Marketplace.” Here, you'll find Salesforce. Kind of like the prized, forgotten chocolate bar you had hidden.

3. **Authorize Integration**
    - On Salesforce from the AppExchange, search and install the "HubSpot Integration." Authorize it. Easy as pie.

4. **Match Game: Map Your Fields**
    - HubSpot will prompt you to map fields. Imagine two puzzle pieces fitting snugly together.
    - Match each HubSpot field with its Salesforce twin—Contact Name to Contact Name, Email to Email. Lisa will thank you later, trust me.

5. **Set Rules for Syncing**
    - Establish whether HubSpot takes precedence over Salesforce or vice versa. Conflict resolution might rival Thanksgiving dinner discussions here, so tread lightly.

## Deepening the Sync: Adding Layers

At this point, I realized Lisa had brought in doughnuts. Coincidence? I think not. Let’s savor this celebratory snack while diving deeper—because consistent syncing is key.

6. **Enable Background Syncing**
    - In HubSpot, ensure that background syncing is activated. This helps keep your contacts fresh and updated without lifting a finger.

7. **Customize Sync Settings**
    - Adjust sync settings to your liking. If bi-directional syncing is your game, go for it. Want to sync specific lists? Set those boundaries. Think of it like setting curfews for your teenagers.

8. **Test the Sync**
    - Create or update a contact and watch it magically appear in the other system. Kind of like witnessing a minor miracle, really.

## The Grand Finale: Monitor and Maintain

Once the primary synching saga is complete, we must ensure the machinery keeps humming.

9. **Regular Check-Ins**
    - Every few weeks, review sync settings. Attune to any errors or challenges. Nothing major—just a quick glance to keep things smooth.

10. **Adjust as Needed**
    - As your strategy evolves, so should your syncing rules. Keep them relevant to your growing contact base.

Reflecting on this fateful Tuesday and subsequent deep dive, there's a peculiar sense of accomplishment seeing our data perfectly mirrored. When Lisa next graces us with another manual contact update out of habit, we'll raise our cups of joe, celebrating small victories in the world of CRM.

So there you have it, friends. From huddled confusion to seamless syncing, all in a day's work. Now, about those doughnuts...
