# How to Customize Pipedrive Workflows

I remember vividly the first time we, my team and I, attempted to customize our Pipedrive workflows. It felt like we were embarking on a grand adventure, albeit one that involved a lot of screen staring and head scratching. Jenny, our team's optimist, believed she could conquer the system in one sitting. "It's just a bit of clicking around," she declared confidently. Spoiler alert: it wasn't. But through the muck and the mire, we found our way, one eureka moment at a time. Now that the hard-earned wisdom is ours, old friends, let’s dive in together.

## Understanding the Goals

Our goal was simple: capture and nurture leads with precision. We needed a structured path that would lead to closing deals, reducing chaos, and improving teamwork. Similar to when Jenny decided to take up knitting - without understanding what a cast on was - we needed *clear instructions* to avoid tangles.

## Step 1: Define Your Pipeline Stages

Imagine sorting LEGO bricks by color - the order is critical. First things first, we needed to identify each step in our sales process. Think of them as the stages of a superhero’s journey. From **Lead In** to **Deal Won**, every heroic act was marked.

1. Go to your Pipedrive dashboard.
2. Click on the top right corner where your profile picture is.
3. From the dropdown menu, select **Company Settings**.
4. Head to the **Pipelines** section.
5. Define each stage by clicking `+Add Stage` and naming it. Avoid anything too cryptic. Simplicity is king here.

I should mention Greg’s great pondering pause when naming. His winner? “Champions Rejoice” for the closing stage.

## Step 2: Customize Your Workflow Automation

Automation, our new best friend, was like getting a self-cleaning oven in the kitchen - life-changing. We decided to streamline by automating tasks that took up too much brain space.

1. Head back to your friendly neighborhood **Company Settings**.
2. Look for **Workflow Automation** under the **Tools and Apps** section.
3. Click `+Create Workflow`. A pop-up appears – quite thrilling.
4. Name your automation (no “Automation #1” nonsense - give it personality).
5. Set triggers (like when a deal is moved to a different stage) and actions (like sending emails).

Warning: Expect moments of “But why isn't it working?”. It's normal.

## Step 3: Incorporate Custom Fields

Jenny’s knitting project needed customizations. So did our Pipedrive. Custom fields were the equivalent of splashes of color on a blank canvas. Data points that made our pipeline sing.

1. Proceed to **Company Settings** once more.
2. Navigate to **Data Fields** under Company Settings.
3. Select **Deals**, **People**, or **Organizations** - wherever customization is needed.
4. Click on `+Add Custom Field` and fill in relevant details.

We realized the magic when adding birthdates to clients, resulting in surprise birthday emails - everyone loves a bit of personal touch.

## Step 4: Use Smart Email Integration

At this point, it’s like Jenny is perfecting the edges on her knitted scarf – now getting sophisticated. Email integration helps track communication without manual logging.

1. Go to **Tools and Apps**.
2. Select **Email Integration**.
3. Follow the steps to sync your email account.
4. Define smart email BCC addresses.

Greg reminisced about that one time an important email went un-tracked – never again, friends.

## Reflection - Our Journey

By the end, our customized workflow was a masterpiece. Jenny's scarf wasn’t half bad either. Every member contributes - their quirks and all - making the process not just functional but delightful. Customization is like creating a comfort space where each function fits perfectly into your work rhythm. Sharing these small victories, remember, makes our professional endeavors all the more human and joyous.

By the way, ever added emojis to workflow names? Pure fun. Try it sometime, you'll thank me.
