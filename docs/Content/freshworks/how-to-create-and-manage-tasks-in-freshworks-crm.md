# How to Create and Manage Tasks in Freshworks CRM

Have you ever sat at your desk, gazing blankly at a flurry of sticky notes plastered along your monitor, trying to remember who you promised a call-back? Well, that was me last Tuesday. Amidst the chaos of running a small business, I realized my life had become a whirlwind of tasks, slipping through the cracks like grains of sand. Then, an epiphany struck—"Isn't there a better way than this madness?"—and that's how Freshworks CRM entered our world like a knight in shining, organized armor.

## The Day Management Became Manageable

Let’s wind back to when Sarah, my colleague, flung open the door with her typical exuberance, waving a smartphone, "I've found it!" she exclaimed. That day marked the beginning of our heartfelt affair with Freshworks CRM. But don’t just take my word; let’s dive into this digital realm and explore how we can wield this tool to conquer our tasks.

### Setting Up Tasks Like a Pro

Here’s where it all begins—setting up that first task. First off, **log into your Freshworks CRM account**. Trust me, it's as easy as pie. There’s a dashboard, and on this dashboard, a button that says, “+ New.” Hit that button like you mean it. Now, select **Task**. It’s here, folks, where magic begins to take form.

Input the task details. We’re talking name, due date, priority—you know the drill. Remember the key here isn’t just to fill in details but to envision an entirely clutter-free future. Now, choose the owner of the task, perhaps yourself ( I always end up with most of them! ). Don’t forget to add a reminder. Trust me, they’re like the gentle tether that keeps you from plummeting into the abyss of forgetfulness.

### Prioritizing Tasks Efficiently

Do you remember how Asimov classified robots? Tasks in Freshworks CRM are similar—except less existentially risky. Once that task dons its digital suit and tie, prioritize it. There’s a dropdown, easy for assigning low, medium, or high priority. Think of it like giving your tasks a VIP pass—or not. Assigning priorities ensures we're not brewing coffee when we should be preparing client presentations. Life, after all, is about priorities, wouldn't you agree?

### Managing and Tracking Progress

“Monitoring is the art of knowing it’s going to rain the day after you planned a picnic.” It’s about staying in the loop, gracefully. To check on task statuses, head over to the **Tasks** tab on that left-hand menu. There’s this eye-pleasing list. You can view it, filter it by status, due date, or owner—just like sorting your socks but way more satisfying. The spreadsheet-style column lets you update status on-the-fly. Click, and voila—your status is updated!

I remember Sarah singing ‘I will survive’ every time we closed out a task. Consider those old sticky-note days behind and feel free to celebrate.

### Recurrence and Reminders: The Secret Sauce

Now, for the pièce de résistance: making your tasks recur. In *Advanced* options, you can tell a task to repeat itself—daily, weekly, whenever it fits your rhythm. Just imagine, setting a client check-in call that you never have to recreate. I like to think of it as our little contribution to the world of perpetual motion.

Set reminders to keep your tasks from becoming Houdinis. They’re life-savers disguised as gentle nudges, ensuring that ‘call-back’ doesn’t remain a pipe dream.

### Wrapping It All Up

Ultimately, using Freshworks CRM is like holding a trusty map while navigating a dense forest. Step by step, our tasks are no longer foes but allies in disguise, hand-holding us through our daily adventures. It transforms the once overwhelming heap of tasks into a familiar trail we love treading. Here’s the end of our exploration—and a toast to no more sticky note walls.

And remember, next time you catch yourself drowning in that deluge of tasks, just think of us with our CRM, sailing smoothly, a cheeky smile, maybe even humming that victory tune.
