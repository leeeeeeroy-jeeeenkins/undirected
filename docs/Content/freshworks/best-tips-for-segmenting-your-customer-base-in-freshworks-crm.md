# Best Tips for Segmenting Your Customer Base in Freshworks CRM

One early morning, while sipping coffee under the glow of my dull desk lamp—which has unwavering loyalty to cast shadows instead of light—I stumbled on a peculiar realization. We were losing customers faster than I could say "end of the quarter." It wasn't long before I met Linda, an erstwhile customer-support-turned-enterprise-guru, who said, "Ever thought of cutting that customer pie the right way?" That conversation birthed this revelation of segmentation within Freshworks CRM, a revolution of sorts.

## Getting to Know Your Customer Buzzes and Hums

Remember when we thought all leads are golden and magical just because they exist? Yeah, those were the days. Linda chuckled with me as we weathered through dog-eared manuals on how Freshworks CRM can morph a chaotic mess of customer data into something beautiful—and dare I say, actionable. Imagine that old shoe-box full of baseball cards finally sorted neatly.

First, let’s gather the essentials. Fire up Freshworks CRM as you would first light a bonfire at summer camp. Head to the "Contacts" tab, the beating heart of your digital rolodex, and start pondering what makes your customer's heart tick. Maybe it’s geographical location, purchasing behavior, or how much time they spend browsing your website (yep, we notice the lurkers too). Your task is to choose up to five so-called attributes that distinguish the fabulous from the forgettable. The ride has just begun!

## Tags: The Conversational Breadcrumbs

Linda would often say, “Talk to your contacts as though they're in your living room.” She meant make it personal, but not creepy-uncle personal. Using tags in CRM is like labeling your collection of old mixtapes that you may or may not have kept from high school. It helps to identify genres of your audience at a glance. I among others used to categorize tags as though organizing a hedgerow, neat and particular. Some customers enjoy the "Weekly Insights" newsletter, others are more "One-time Special Event" aficionados. 

Head to "Settings" in Freshworks CRM and under "Contacts," find the “Manage Tags” option. Create, edit, remove, go wild—just like rearranging furniture, but less heavy lifting. And when Linda and I paired these tags with freshly baked segments, it was like discovering chocolate chips in your otherwise mundane loaf of banana bread.

## The Filters That Define the Universe

There we were, Linda and I carved out distinct customer galaxies in the CRM universe. Filters in Freshworks let you sift through the cosmic storm of data with precision akin to a barista deciding just the right amount of foam. Navigate to the "All Contacts" section and click “Add Filter.” I got lost the first time, but once guided, my eyes opened to new possibilities. Allow yourself to experiment with conditions and parameters like "last contacted date" or "purchase history."

Linda once said, "Use the filters as if peering through a kaleidoscope. What do you see? A chaotic blend or intricate symmetry?” And indeed, once filtered, the picture of our clientele looked less like a Rorschach test and more like a plan for success.

## Embrace Dynamic Segmentation

In this fast-paced world, our customers evolve. Just like my taste in music has grown to include more...mature selections than my punk-rock days. Freshworks has this nifty feature: Dynamic Segments. They adapt automatically—much like how Linda miraculously transformed suspicious spreadsheets into coherent financial statements.

Enable dynamic segments by setting up rules, and watch your segments update as if by magic, molding gracefully to changes. This newfound flexibility means we can relax slightly, knowing Freshworks adapts with us—and not against us.

## The Endearing Wrap-Up

If there's one thing Linda taught me, besides blending cool wit with rapid-fire problem-solving, it's that the essence of Freshworks CRM is not just algorithmic precision but understanding the human elements beneath. So, as we reflect back, let’s take these serene moments with Freshworks, chop our customer base in a way that doesn’t make them cry, and embrace the endless intricacies of this art. After all, segmentation is less about the slices and more about savoring the pie.
