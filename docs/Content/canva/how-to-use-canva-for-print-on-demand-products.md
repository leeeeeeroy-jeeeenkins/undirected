# How to Use Canva for Print on Demand Products

I remember that scorching summer afternoon vividly. Jenny and I were perched on barstools in her cluttered kitchen, eyes glued to her laptop screen. We were two brave souls embarking on the seemingly daunting adventure of creating print on demand products. Armed with iced coffees and boundless enthusiasm, we dove headfirst into Canva. It was Jenny’s idea, really—her boundless optimism was contagious. That day, something clicked; revelation struck like a lightning bolt. Simply put, Canva became our secret weapon. Let me walk you through how we did it. Together.

## Getting Started with Canva

"Canva," we mused, sipping our lukewarm coffee, "sounds easy, right?" But oh, the options! Where does one even begin? First, we needed an idea. We hit the Explore tab, clicking hungrily through layouts and elements until we found it: the perfect design for our quirky T-shirt venture. To unlock Canva’s full potential, you need an account—easy peasy. It was like picking out ice creams on a blistering day; we signed up, and just like that, a world of creativity unfolded before us.

Jenny, bless her heart, spotted the "Custom Dimensions" option. My sides still hurt from laughing at her exaggerated Eureka moment. We chose the dimensions specific to our products. We shrugged to ourselves, "What dimension magic could we concoct today?" Clicking and dragging, making mistakes, reveling in our growing masterpiece.

## Designing Your Product

Creating the design felt like standing before a blank canvas, quite literally. We started with templates—you know, these are like training wheels for novice creators. We found a funky one and began working our magic. Jenny was the queen of text—she found the most garish, glorious font. Fonts so beautiful, they deserved to be celebrated, framed, sung to the heavens. I, armed with clip art and an innate rebellious spirit, tweaked illustrations to fit our theme. Balance. Collaboration. Camaraderie.

Our imaginations grew wild. We used images, filters, fancy text tricks. The Undo button, our comforting safety net. We pinned layers, shuffled colors; iteration was our ally. Canva offered a sea, nay—a universe—of options. We lost track of time, as if spellbound. The designs reflected us, two dreamers crafting our own narrative.

## Reviewing and Finalizing

Mistakes? We had our share. An inadvertent pixel spill here, a stray comma there. Perseverance pays off. We proofread everything—scrutinizing like detectives on a deadline. The preview feature, our magnifying lens, revealed all. We composed, recalibrated, and concocted a creation that felt truly ours.

Hitting that download button felt like sealing an ancient deal. Formats galore! PNG for a crisp, clean finish. Our anticipation was palpable, like children awaiting a carnival ride. Jenny's grin, unforgettable, wide enough to eclipse the sun. What a feeling.

## Printing on Demand

With designs ready, we ventured onto print on demand platforms like Redbubble and Teespring. Easy. Like ordering extra toppings on a pizza; each site has its own peculiarities. We took careful notes. Customer satisfaction guaranteed. Triumph! Our designs, unleashed into the world, floated like joyous kites.

So here we are, Jenny and I, reminiscing. Paint splattered memories etched in time. Creativity unleashed, friends forever changed. Canva for print on demand products—simple yet profound. We gained more than profit. We gained a sprinkle of magic; a shared secret cloaked in digital wonder. And our designs? They live on, out there, whispering our tale.
